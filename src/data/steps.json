You start here in the understanding that you are without Knowledge. That is not to say that Knowledge is not with you. It is simply to say that you are not with Knowledge. Knowledge is waiting for you to proceed. Knowledge is waiting to give itself to you. Therefore, you are beginning now to prepare to be in relationship with Knowledge, the greater aspect of mind that you have brought with you from your Ancient Home. Three times today spend 10 minutes thinking about what Knowledge is, not merely applying your own ideas, not merely applying your past understanding, but thinking about what Knowledge really is.",

Knowledge is with you, but where are you? Today think about where you are. If you are not with Knowledge, where are you? Therefore, three times today, 10 minutes each, think about where you are, not just physically or geographically, but where you are in terms of your awareness of yourself in the world. Think very, very carefully. Do not allow your mind to distract you from this orientation. It is essential now at the beginning of your preparation to ask these questions very seriously.",

  "instructions": "In your two long practice periods today, each of which should be at least 45 minutes, review the past two weeks of your practice. Read each lesson slowly and carefully, and recall your practice and your experiences with each one. Allow each one to penetrate your mind. See their application in your life. See their relationship to one another. See how they are beginning to reveal a greater truth to you. See how they are beginning to reveal your own nature to you. See how they are beginning to reveal your purpose in the world. This review will take time, but it will be a great confirmation for you and it will give strength to your ability to learn and to prepare.",
