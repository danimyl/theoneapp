# Notification System Update: Reversion to Expo Managed Workflow

This document outlines the changes made to the notification system in TheOneApp mobile application, specifically the reversion from a bare React Native workflow with Notifee to a strictly managed Expo workflow with prebuild.

## Change Summary

We have reverted from using Notifee for notifications in a bare React Native workflow to using Expo's built-in notification system in a managed Expo workflow with prebuild. This change was made after encountering significant build and compatibility issues with the Notifee implementation.

## Rationale

The Notifee implementation, while offering advanced notification features, presented several challenges:

1. **Build Failures**: Consistent build failures on iOS due to native module configuration issues
2. **Compatibility Issues**: Conflicts with Expo's native module system
3. **Maintenance Complexity**: Increased complexity in maintaining native code for both platforms
4. **Upgrade Difficulties**: Challenges when upgrading React Native or Expo versions

By reverting to a strictly managed Expo workflow with prebuild, we gain:

1. **Simplified Builds**: More reliable build process managed by Expo
2. **Reduced Complexity**: No need to maintain native code directly
3. **Better Upgrade Path**: Easier upgrades of React Native and Expo versions
4. **Consistent API**: Using Expo's notification API across the entire app

## Implementation Details

The following changes were made:

1. **Removed Notifee Dependency**:
   - Removed `@notifee/react-native` from package.json
   - Uninstalled the package with `npm uninstall @notifee/react-native`

2. **Deleted Native Folders**:
   - Removed the `ios` and `android` directories to allow Expo to generate them fresh during prebuild
   - Updated `.gitignore` to include `/ios` and `/android` directories

3. **Updated app.json Configuration**:
   - Configured for strict Expo workflow
   - Set up notification plugins properly
   - Configured background fetch capabilities
   - Disabled the new architecture and set JSC as the JavaScript engine

4. **Updated eas.json for Build Stability**:
   - Specified a specific macOS/Xcode image for iOS builds
   - Disabled build cache to ensure clean builds

5. **Rewrote Notification Service**:
   - Removed all Notifee imports and references
   - Updated to use only Expo's notification APIs
   - Maintained all existing notification functionality

## Notification Features Preserved

All existing notification features have been preserved:

1. **Hourly Reminders**: Notifications at the top of each hour for the current step
2. **Practice Reminders**: Daily reminders for incomplete practices
3. **Timer Completion**: Sound and notification when a practice timer completes
4. **Quiet Hours**: Respecting the user's configured quiet hours
5. **Background Notifications**: Notifications even when the app is in the background or closed

## Testing

To test the updated notification system:

1. **Hourly Reminders**:
   - Enable hourly reminders for the current step or enable "Always Show Hourly Reminders"
   - Wait until the top of the hour to verify notifications are received

2. **Practice Reminders**:
   - Enable practice reminders in Settings
   - Set a reminder time a few minutes in the future
   - Leave some practices unchecked
   - Verify the reminder notification is received at the specified time

3. **Timer Completion**:
   - Start a practice timer
   - Let it complete
   - Verify the completion sound plays and notification appears

4. **Background Notifications**:
   - Configure hourly or practice reminders
   - Close the app completely
   - Verify notifications are still received at the appropriate times

## Building the App

To build the app with the new configuration:

1. **Development Build**:
   ```
   eas build --platform ios --profile development
   ```

2. **Production Build**:
   ```
   eas build --platform ios --profile production
   ```

## Related Updates

As part of this notification system update, we've also made improvements to the Android foreground service notification:

1. **Updated Notification Message**: Clearer message explaining the purpose of the notification
2. **Daily Restart Mechanism**: Automatic restart of the foreground service each day
3. **User Control**: Users can dismiss the notification if they don't want hourly reminders

## Future Considerations

While the current Expo notification system meets our needs, we may consider the following improvements in the future:

1. **Enhanced Notification Grouping**: Better organization of multiple notifications
2. **Custom Notification Sounds**: Support for user-selected notification sounds
3. **Rich Notifications**: Adding images or action buttons to notifications
4. **Improved User Controls**: More granular control over notification behavior

However, these enhancements will be implemented within the Expo ecosystem rather than reverting to a bare workflow with Notifee or other native notification libraries.

## Conclusion

The reversion to a strictly managed Expo workflow with prebuild provides a more stable, maintainable solution for our notification needs. While we lose some advanced features that Notifee offered, the benefits of simplified builds, reduced maintenance, and better upgrade paths outweigh these limitations for our current requirements.
