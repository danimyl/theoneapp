# Foreground Service Notification Update

This document outlines the changes made to the Android foreground service notification in TheOneApp mobile application.

## Change Summary

The foreground service notification has been updated with:

1. A more informative message that explains its purpose to users
2. A daily restart mechanism that refreshes the notification each day
3. Tracking of the last service start date to prevent multiple notifications per day

## Rationale

The previous foreground service notification displayed "Running in background to deliver your notifications" which didn't clearly explain to users what would happen if they dismissed it. This led to confusion and potentially disrupted the hourly notification functionality.

The new implementation:
- Clearly communicates the consequences of dismissing the notification
- Automatically restarts the service each day to ensure reliability
- Prevents multiple notifications from appearing on the same day

## Implementation Details

### 1. Updated Notification Message

The notification message has been changed to:

```
"Hourly reminders will play until you clear this notification"
```

This clearly informs users that:
- The notification is related to hourly reminders
- Dismissing it will stop the hourly reminders
- They have control over whether to keep or dismiss it

### 2. Daily Restart Mechanism

A daily restart mechanism has been added that:
- Tracks the last date the foreground service was started
- Checks if it's a new day when the app is opened
- Automatically restarts the service if it's a new day

This ensures that:
- Users get a fresh notification each day
- The service is reliably restarted after being dismissed
- Users maintain control over notifications on a daily basis

### 3. Implementation Changes

The following changes were made to implement this feature:

1. **Added tracking in settings store:**
   - Added `lastForegroundServiceDate` to track when the service was last started
   - Added `setLastForegroundServiceDate` action to update this value

2. **Updated setupAndroidForegroundService method:**
   - Changed notification message to be more informative
   - Added code to store the current date when the service is started

3. **Modified App.tsx initialization:**
   - Added check for new day or first run
   - Only starts the foreground service if it's a new day or hasn't been started yet
   - Logs the decision for debugging purposes

## User Experience

From the user's perspective:

1. When they open the app each day, they'll see a notification explaining that hourly reminders will play until they clear it
2. If they want hourly reminders throughout the day, they leave the notification in place
3. If they don't want hourly reminders, they can dismiss the notification
4. The next day, the notification will appear again, giving them a fresh choice

This approach balances functionality with user control, ensuring that:
- Users understand what the notification does
- Users can choose whether to receive hourly reminders
- The choice resets each day, preventing permanent dismissal
- The system remains reliable and predictable

## Testing

To test this feature:

1. Open the app and verify the notification appears with the new message
2. Note the current date (this is when the service was started)
3. Dismiss the notification
4. Close and reopen the app on the same day - the notification should NOT reappear
5. Change your device date to the next day
6. Open the app - the notification should reappear with the new message
7. Verify hourly reminders work as expected when the notification is present
8. Verify hourly reminders stop when the notification is dismissed

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to this system:

1. Add a setting to control whether the foreground service notification appears at all
2. Allow users to customize the notification priority or appearance
3. Implement a more sophisticated restart mechanism that considers user preferences
4. Add analytics to track how often users keep vs. dismiss the notification
