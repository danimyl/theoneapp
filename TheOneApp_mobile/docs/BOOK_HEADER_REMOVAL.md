# Book Header Removal

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to remove the "Book" header from the Book screen in the mobile app. Similar to the Steps screen, we wanted to remove the top navigation header to make the chapter title the topmost element on the page.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

1. Modified the Book screen tab options in `App.tsx` to hide the header:

```typescript
<Tab.Screen 
  name="Book" 
  component={BookScreen}
  options={{
    headerShown: false, // Hide the header completely
    tabBarIcon: ({ color, size }: { color: string; size: number }) => (
      <Ionicons name="book" size={size} color={color} />
    ),
  }}
/>
```

### Before and After

**Before:**
- The Book screen had a navigation header at the top with the text "Book"
- The chapter title appeared below this header

**After:**
- The "Book" header is completely removed
- The chapter title is now the topmost element on the page
- The content layout remains unchanged

## Rationale

The "Book" header was redundant since:
1. The bottom tab navigation already indicates which section the user is in
2. The chapter title provides more specific context about what the user is viewing
3. Removing the header provides more screen space for content

This change is consistent with the approach taken for the Steps screen, where the header was also removed to maximize content space and improve the user experience.

## Related Changes

This change follows the same pattern as the Steps screen header removal documented in [HEADER_REMOVAL.md](./HEADER_REMOVAL.md).
