# Source Link Addition

## Overview

Added a simple hyperlink at the bottom of each book chapter that says "Read this Teaching on newmessage.org" and opens the browser to the source URL when tapped.

## Implementation Details

1. **Added Source Link to BookContentScreen.tsx**:
   - Added a Text component after the CustomHtmlRenderer
   - The link only appears if `currentContent.sourceUrl` exists
   - Styled as a standard blue hyperlink with underline
   - Uses the existing `Linking.openURL()` functionality to open the browser

2. **Styling**:
   - Used standard hyperlink blue color (#0000FF)
   - Added underline for visual indication that it's a link
   - Added margin at the top to separate it from the content
   - Added significant bottom padding (60px) to ensure there's plenty of space below the link
   - Centered the text

## Code Changes

```tsx
{/* Source Link - only shown when sourceUrl is available */}
{currentContent.sourceUrl && (
  <Text 
    style={styles.sourceLink}
    onPress={() => Linking.openURL(currentContent.sourceUrl)}
  >
    Read this Teaching on newmessage.org
  </Text>
)}
```

Added style:

```tsx
sourceLink: {
  color: '#0000FF',  // Standard hyperlink blue
  textDecorationLine: 'underline',
  marginTop: 24,
  marginBottom: 60,  // Add a lot of padding below the link
  textAlign: 'center',
},
```

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced User Experience**: Provides a direct link to the original source of the teaching
2. **Cross-Platform Access**: Allows users to easily access the web version if needed
3. **Attribution**: Properly attributes the content to its original source
4. **Additional Resources**: Gives users access to potentially more content or related materials on the website

## Testing

The link appears at the bottom of each chapter that has a sourceUrl property in its content JSON file. When tapped, it opens the device's default browser to the specified URL.
