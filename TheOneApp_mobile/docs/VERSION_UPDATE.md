# Version Update: 1.0.0 â†’ 1.1.0

## Overview

The mobile app version has been updated from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0 to align with the web app version. This ensures consistency across platforms and simplifies version tracking.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated package.json**
   - Changed version from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0

2. **Updated app.json**
   - Changed Expo version from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0

## Benefits

1. **Version Alignment**
   - Web app and mobile app now share the same version number (1.1.0)
   - Easier to track feature parity between platforms

2. **Release Management**
   - Simplifies release planning and documentation
   - Provides a clear versioning strategy moving forward

3. **User Communication**
   - Consistent version numbers across platforms reduce confusion
   - Makes it easier to communicate about features in release notes

## Semantic Versioning

This update follows semantic versioning principles:
- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes (0)
- **MINOR** version for new functionality in a backward compatible manner (1)
- **PATCH** version for backward compatible bug fixes (0)

The increment from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0 represents the addition of new features without breaking changes.

## Next Steps

For future updates, both web and mobile versions should be incremented together to maintain alignment. This can be done by:

1. Determining the appropriate version increment based on the nature of changes
2. Updating both package.json files simultaneously
3. Updating the app.json file for the mobile app
4. Documenting the version change and included features/fixes
