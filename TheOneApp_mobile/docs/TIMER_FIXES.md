# Timer System Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to fix issues with the timer system in the mobile app. The main problems were:

1. Multiple timers running simultaneously
2. Timer auto-starting when the app opens
3. Timer running too fast
4. Infinite update loops causing "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors

## Complete Timer Redesign

After multiple attempts to fix the timer implementation, we decided to completely redesign the timer system with a much simpler approach that uses basic React patterns.

### 1. New Approach: useSimpleTimer

We abandoned the complex TimerEngine class and created a new, simpler timer hook:

- Uses standard `setInterval` for timing instead of requestAnimationFrame
- Calculates time based on end time rather than elapsed time
- Maintains a clean separation between timer logic and UI updates
- Uses a straightforward implementation with fewer moving parts

### 2. Key Features

- **Simplified Timer Logic**: Basic interval-based countdown with clear start/end logic
- **End Time Calculation**: Uses absolute timestamps to calculate remaining time
- **Throttled UI Updates**: Limits UI updates to prevent excessive re-renders
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures only one timer can run at a time
- **Clean Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of intervals and resources

### 3. Benefits of the New Design

- **Reliability**: Simpler code with fewer edge cases and failure points
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and debug
- **Performance**: Fewer re-renders and better state management
- **Accuracy**: More reliable timing based on absolute timestamps

## Implementation Details

### useSimpleTimer.ts

- Uses standard `setInterval` for timing
- Calculates remaining time based on end time
- Implements singleton pattern to prevent multiple timers
- Provides a clean interface with start, pause, resume, and stop methods
- Properly cleans up resources when unmounting

### StepsScreen.tsx

- Updated to use the new useSimpleTimer hook
- Simplified timer state management
- Improved timer persistence logic
- Better error handling and recovery

## Testing

To verify the fixes:

1. Start a timer on one step
2. Navigate to another step and verify the floating icon appears
3. Try to start a timer on another step (should be disabled)
4. Close and reopen the app - no timer should auto-start
5. Verify the timer runs at the correct speed

## Future Improvements

- Add more comprehensive error handling
- Improve the timer persistence mechanism
- Add more visual feedback for timer state changes
- Consider adding offline timer support
