# Notification System Improvement

This document outlines the improvements made to the notification system to enhance lock screen notifications and timing precision in the Expo managed workflow.

## Changes Made

### 1. Notification Service Optimization

The `notificationService.ts` file has been updated with the following improvements:

- **Enhanced Lock Screen Support**: Added critical priority and interrupt level settings for iOS to ensure notifications appear even when the device is locked
- **Improved Timing Precision**: Using timestamp triggers and alarm clock priority for more accurate notification timing
- **Simplified Background Task Handling**: Reduced minimum interval to 15 minutes (iOS minimum) for more frequent background checks
- **Streamlined Code**: More concise implementation with the same functionality
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error logging and recovery

### 2. App Configuration Updates

The `app.json` file has been updated with the following changes:

- **Disabled Updates**: Set `"updates": { "enabled": false }` to prevent automatic updates that might interfere with notification behavior
- **JavaScript Engine**: Set `"jsEngine": "jsc"` for better performance
- **Disabled New Architecture**: Set `"newArchEnabled": false"` for better compatibility
- **Simplified Permissions**: Removed redundant Android permissions while keeping essential ones
- **Optimized Background Modes**: Streamlined iOS background modes to focus on fetch operations
- **Improved Plugin Configuration**: Enhanced notification plugin settings

### 3. Build Configuration Updates

The `eas.json` file has been updated to use the macOS Monterey with Xcode 15 build image for iOS production builds, which provides better support for the notification features.

## Post-Revert Instructions

To complete the implementation of these improvements, follow these steps:

1. **Clean Native Code**:
   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild --clean
   ```
   This will regenerate the native code with the new configuration.

2. **Build for iOS**:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform ios --profile production --clear-cache
   ```
   This will build the iOS app using the macOS Monterey with Xcode 15 image.

3. **Build for Android**:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform android --profile production --clear-cache
   ```
   This will build the Android app with the new notification configuration.

## Testing

After building and installing the app, test the following scenarios:

1. **Lock Screen Notifications**: Verify that notifications appear on the lock screen
2. **Timing Precision**: Check that hourly notifications arrive at the expected time
3. **Background Operation**: Ensure notifications continue to work when the app is in the background
4. **Sleep Hours**: Confirm that notifications are silenced during configured sleep hours
5. **Timer Completion Sound**: Test that timer completion sounds play even when the device is locked

Report any issues with specific details about the device, OS version, and the exact behavior observed.
