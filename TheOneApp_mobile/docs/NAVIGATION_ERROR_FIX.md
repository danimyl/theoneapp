# Navigation Error Fix

## Problem

When navigating between book chapters in the mobile app, three issues were occurring:

1. Some chapters were causing the following error:
   ```
   Unable to find viewState for tag 372. Surface stopped: false
   ```

2. After the initial fix, performance warnings appeared:
   ```
   WARN You seem to update the onDocumentMetadataLoaded or onTTreeChange prop(s) of the "RenderHTML" component in short periods of time, causing costly tree rerenders
   ```

3. After removing the callbacks, text became unreadable and the text size controls stopped working, with new warnings:
   ```
   WARN You seem to update props of the "TRenderEngineProvider" component in short periods of time, causing costly tree rerenders
   ```

## Root Cause

The fundamental issue was with the RenderHtml library itself. This third-party component was causing various problems:

1. Race conditions during navigation leading to view state errors
2. Performance issues due to frequent re-renders
3. Rendering issues when we tried to optimize it

After multiple attempts to fix the issues while keeping the RenderHtml component, we determined that the library itself was the source of the problems.

## Solution: Custom HTML Renderer

Instead of continuing to troubleshoot the RenderHtml library, we created a custom HTML renderer from scratch that:

1. Uses only native React Native components
2. Has minimal dependencies
3. Is optimized for our specific use case
4. Supports all the features we need (text formatting, links, etc.)

### 1. Created a new CustomHtmlRenderer component

```jsx
// CustomHtmlRenderer.tsx
export const CustomHtmlRenderer: React.FC<CustomHtmlRendererProps> = ({ 
  html, 
  textSize,
  onLinkPress 
}) => {
  // Parse HTML and convert to React Native components
  const renderedContent = useMemo(() => {
    // Implementation details...
    
    // Convert HTML to React Native components
    return paragraphs.map((paragraph, index) => {
      // Handle headings, lists, blockquotes, and paragraphs
      // ...
    });
  }, [html, textSize, onLinkPress]);
  
  return (
    <View>
      {renderedContent}
    </View>
  );
};
```

The custom renderer:
- Parses HTML content into paragraphs
- Handles basic HTML tags (headings, lists, blockquotes, links)
- Applies text styling based on the current text size
- Properly handles links with onPress events
- Uses memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### 2. Updated BookContentScreen to use the custom renderer

```jsx
// BookContentScreen.tsx
<ScrollView style={styles.contentScroll}>
  <View style={styles.contentContainer}>
    <CustomHtmlRenderer
      html={currentContent.content}
      textSize={textSize}
      onLinkPress={handleLinkPress}
    />
  </View>
</ScrollView>
```

### 3. Removed all dependencies on RenderHtml

- Removed imports for RenderHtml
- Removed all the complex styling and configuration for RenderHtml
- Simplified the component structure

## Benefits of the New Approach

1. **Simplicity**: The custom renderer is much simpler than the RenderHtml library, making it easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Performance**: By using only native React Native components, we avoid the overhead of the RenderHtml library.

3. **Control**: We have complete control over the rendering process, allowing us to optimize it for our specific use case.

4. **Reliability**: The custom renderer is less prone to race conditions and other issues that were occurring with RenderHtml.

5. **Text Size Controls**: The text size controls now work properly because we directly apply the text size to our custom components.

## Testing

The fix has been tested by:

1. Navigating between multiple chapters in the app
2. Testing chapters that previously caused the error
3. Verifying that content loads correctly in all cases
4. Ensuring that the app doesn't crash during navigation
5. Checking for performance warnings in the console
6. Verifying that text is readable and text size controls work

## UI Improvements

In addition to fixing the rendering issues, we've also made some UI improvements:

1. **Moved Audio Controls**: Relocated the audio player from the header to the text size controls row
   - This creates a cleaner header that focuses on the chapter title
   - Groups media controls (text size and audio) together in one row
   - Improves the overall user experience by organizing related controls together

The updated UI layout:
```
+------------------------------------------+
| Chapter Title                      Menu  |
+------------------------------------------+
| Text Size Controls        Audio Controls |
+------------------------------------------+
|                                          |
|               Content                    |
|                                          |
+------------------------------------------+
```

## Conclusion

By replacing the problematic third-party library with our own custom implementation, we've addressed all the issues that were occurring with the book content display. This approach gives us more control, better performance, and a more reliable user experience.

The key insight was that sometimes it's better to build a simpler custom solution than to continue trying to fix issues with a complex third-party library, especially when the library is causing fundamental problems that are difficult to resolve.

The UI improvements further enhance the user experience by providing a cleaner, more organized interface for reading and interacting with the book content.
