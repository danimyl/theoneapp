# Line Break Fix for Book Content

## Problem

The book content in the mobile app was displaying as a solid wall of text without respecting paragraph breaks. This was happening because:

1. The `CustomHtmlRenderer` component was replacing all whitespace (including newlines) with a single space
2. The renderer wasn't properly handling newline characters (`\n`) in the content
3. This resulted in paragraphs running together without proper spacing

## Solution

The solution involved modifying the `CustomHtmlRenderer.tsx` component to:

1. Preserve newline characters during the initial HTML cleanup
2. Add support for rendering text with line breaks in all content types:
   - Regular paragraphs
   - Headings
   - Blockquotes
   - List items

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Preserve Newlines During Cleanup

Changed the whitespace normalization regex to only affect horizontal whitespace:

```typescript
// Before
const cleanHtml = html
  .replace(/\n\s*\n/g, '\n\n')  // Normalize multiple line breaks
  .replace(/\s+/g, ' ')         // Normalize whitespace - removes newlines!
  .trim();

// After
const cleanHtml = html
  .replace(/\n\s*\n/g, '\n\n')  // Normalize multiple line breaks
  .replace(/[ \t]+/g, ' ')      // Normalize horizontal whitespace only, preserve newlines
  .trim();
```

#### 2. Enhanced Paragraph Rendering

Added a helper function to render text with line breaks:

```typescript
const renderWithLineBreaks = (content: string, isLink = false, url = '') => {
  // Split by newlines but preserve them for rendering
  const lines = content.split('\n');
  
  return lines.map((line, lineIndex) => {
    // Render each line separately
    // Add a newline character after each line except the last one
    return (
      <Text key={`text-line-${lineIndex}`}>
        {line}
        {lineIndex < lines.length - 1 && '\n'}
      </Text>
    );
  });
};
```

#### 3. Updated All Rendering Functions

Modified all content rendering functions to handle newlines:

- `renderHeading`: Now splits heading text by newlines and renders each line
- `renderBlockquote`: Now splits quote text by newlines and renders each line
- `renderList`: Now splits list item text by newlines and renders each line
- `renderParagraph`: Now uses the `renderWithLineBreaks` helper function

## Benefits

1. **Improved Readability**: Text now displays with proper paragraph breaks
2. **Better Content Structure**: The visual hierarchy of the content is preserved
3. **Consistent Rendering**: All content types (paragraphs, headings, quotes, lists) handle line breaks consistently

## Testing

This implementation has been tested with various content files that contain multiple paragraphs and line breaks. The text now displays properly with paragraph breaks preserved.
