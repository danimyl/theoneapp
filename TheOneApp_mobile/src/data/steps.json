Knowledge is waiting for you to proceed. Knowledge is waiting to give itself to you. Therefore, you are beginning now to prepare to be in relationship with Knowledge, the greater aspect of mind that you have brought with you from your Ancient Home. Three times today spend 10 minutes thinking about what Knowledge is, not merely applying your own ideas, not merely applying your past understanding, but thinking about what Knowledge really is.",

Knowledge is with you, but where are you? Today think about where you are. If you are not with Knowledge, where are you? Therefore, three times today, 10 minutes each, think about where you are, not just physically or geographically, but where you are in terms of your awareness of yourself in the world. Think very, very carefully. Do not allow your mind to distract you from this orientation. It is essential now at the beginning of your preparation to ask these questions very seriously.",

Today in your three brief practice periods, in which you devote your total attention to examining your assumptions, think about the things you really think you know, including things that you have not thought to question before—things that you think you know. Today’s exercise, then, carries forth from the previous steps where you begin to see the difference between what you think you know and real Knowledge itself and the relationship between what you think of as Knowledge and your own assumptions, beliefs and hopes for things. Therefore, in each practice session it is very essential for you to think about the things you think you know. When you realize they are based primarily upon your assumptions, you will realize how weak is your foundation in the world.

What you are and what you have today must be your starting point. Therefore, in your three practice periods today, think about this statement. Examine what you believe and then examine what you want.

If you wish to live anything greater than a purely superficial and unstable life, you must penetrate deeper and not be confident based only upon weak assumptions and hopeful expectations. There is a greater gift awaiting you, but you must prepare yourself mentally, emotionally and physically. Without Knowledge, you are unaware of your purpose. You are unaware of your origin and your destiny, and you will pass through this life as if it were a troubled dream and no more. ~ Let Us say that Knowledge is not the things that are usually associated with it. It is not ideas. It is not a body of information. It is not a system of belief. It is not a process of self-evaluation. It is the great mystery of your life. Its outward manifestations are profound intuition, great insight, inexplicable knowing, wise perception in the present and in the future and wise understanding of the past.

The truth always brings resolution of conflict, always provides an experience of self, always gives you a sense of current reality and always provides direction for you to move forward. Today, in your three 15-minute practice periods, practice listening to the truth, trying to listen beyond the mind and emotions.

It is something you must feel. To have a feeling orientation, your mind must be still. Truth is something you will feel with your entire body, with your entire being. Knowledge does not speak to you at every moment, but it always holds a message for you. To come into the proximity of Knowledge means that you become more and more like Knowledge itself—more whole, more consistent, more honest, more devoted, more concentrated, more selfdisciplined, more compassionate and more self-loving. All of these qualities are developed as you approach that which is the source of these qualities. It is in this direction that you will practice moving today as you feel the truth arising within yourself. This will join all aspects of you, giving you a uniform experience of yourself. In your three 15-minute practice periods, give your full attention to feeling the truth arising within yourself. Practice in stillness, and do not be discouraged if it is difficult at first.

God’s Plan is invisible and recognized by very few because very few have the openness of mind and the quality of attention that will allow them to see what is obviously occurring around them, which at this point is not obvious to them at all. Your Teachers love you, surround you and support you, for you are emerging into Knowledge. This calls them to your side. You are one of the few who has the promise and the opportunity to emerge from the sleep of your own imagination into the grace of Reality. Therefore, in your two practice periods today, feel this love, support and direction. It is a feeling. It is not ideas. It is a feeling. It is something you must feel. Love is something you must feel to know. You are indeed loved, surrounded and supported by your Teachers, and you are very worthy of their great gift to you.",

Your Teachers surround you and provide that which you are so that you may experience yourself and your true relationship with life. In your two practice periods today, practice receiving once again the love, support and direction of your Teachers, and if any thought obstructs this, if any feeling prevents this, remind yourself of your great worthiness. You are worthy not for what you have done in the world. You are worthy for who you are, where you have come from and where you are going. Your life may be filled with errors and mistakes, wrong decisions and poor choices, but you have still come from your Ancient Home to which you will return. Your worthiness in the sight of God is unchanged. There is only great effort to repair your errors so that you may experience your True Self so that it may be rendered into the world. Therefore, in your practice periods, practice receptivity and experiencing true worthiness. Let no thought conflict with the greatest truth of life.",

Eventually you will experience great relationship with those in your outer life, but first you must experience the source of your great relationship in its true establishment already. Then it is a matter of merely transferring it to the world outside, which you will do naturally in time. In your two practice periods, practice feeling this relationship. Again you are asked to receive because you must receive this to give it. Once it is received, it will give of itself naturally. In the process of this your worth is re-established because it is quite apparent. You do not need to misrepresent yourself or your experience. To share a great love honestly means you must be experiencing it. It is this experience that We wish to give you today.",

      "instructions": "It is pointless to justify error, but error can bring you to value truth, and in this it can lead to true Knowledge. This is its only possible value. We do not condone error, but if error occurs, We wish to make it serve your truest need so that you may learn from it and repeat it no more. It is not merely for you to forget your errors, for you cannot do that. It is not merely for you to justify your errors, for this will make you dishonest. It is not merely for you to look upon your errors as pure service to you, for they have indeed been painful. What this truly means is that you recognize that error is error and then you attempt to use it on your own behalf. The pain of error and the tribulation of error must be accepted, for this will teach you what is real and what is not, what to value and what not to value. Using your error for development means you have accepted the error, and now you are attempting to utilize it to derive value from it because until value is derived from error, it is error only and will be a source of pain and discomfort for you. Today, in your two 30-minute practice periods, look at specific errors that you have made that have been very painful. Do not try to dismiss the pain of them, but see how in your current circumstances in life you can use them for your own benefit. Using errors in this way can show you what you need to do and what corrections or adjustments need to be made to enhance the quality of your life. Remember that any resolution to error always engenders true recognition and true discernment in relationship. In your practice periods review the errors that come to mind as you sit quietly alone, and then see how each one can be utilized to your current benefit. What needs to be learned from them? What must be done that was not done before? What must not be done that was done before? How can these errors be recognized in advance? What were the signs that preceded them and how can such signs be recognized in advance of error in the future? Use these practice periods for this introspective process and when you are done, do not speak of the results to any other person, but allow the investigation to continue naturally, as it naturally will.",

      "instructions": "This affirmation represents your true will. If you are not feeling this, it means that you are entertaining something that is false and without true foundation in your being. If you have ever felt that the truth betrayed you, then you have not recognized its value. Perhaps it disappointed your plans and goals. Perhaps you lost something you really wanted. Perhaps it prevented you from seeking something that was desirable. But in all cases it has saved you from pain and misery. Until your true function has been recognized, you cannot appreciate how the truth has served you, for until your function is discovered, you will attempt to claim and justify other functions. If these other functions are discouraged or denied by the truth, there can be great confusion and conflict. Yet remember that the truth has always saved you from a greater error that you would have committed otherwise. People cannot experience Knowledge because they are preoccupied with thoughts and judgments. These thoughts and judgments create a self-enclosed world for an individual, a selfenclosed world where they cannot see out. They can only see the content of their thoughts and this colors their experience of life entirely, so much so that they cannot see life at all. Therefore, in your two 30-minute practice periods, look and see how the truth has served you. Look at experiences that were happy. Look at experiences that were painful. Particularly in painful experiences, look at how the truth has served you. Look openly. Do not defend a former position if you are tempted to do so. If pain still exists from a loss of an earlier time, accept that pain and its discouragement, but try to look and see how you were truly served by that loss. This point of view of being served by your experience is something you must cultivate. It does not justify the experience itself. Understand this. It merely gives you an opportunity to use your experience for your advancement and your empowerment. Truth operates in the world of illusions to help those who are responding to truth in their lives. You are responding to truth or you would not be undertaking this program of development. Thus, you have arrived at the juncture where it seems that the truth competes with other things and is, therefore, very hard to recognize. In this program of development, the truth will be distinguished from everything else in such a way that you can experience it directly and will not be confused about its appearance or its beneficial existence in your life. For the truth is here to serve you as you are here to serve the truth.",

I accept the miracles of my life as a demonstration of the presence of Knowledge, and I give myself now to cultivate that which is of the greatest good within myself to be given to the world.” Once again We shall review the past week of practice, rereading all of the instructions and with each step reviewing what has transpired in your times of practice. Be sure to ask yourself how deeply you were involved in practice—how much you wanted to search and investigate, how carefully you examined your own experience and to what extent you felt motivated to penetrate whatever barriers that might exist. Our one 45-minute practice period of review will begin to give you a perspective on your development in this preparation. This is beneficial not only for yourself but for those whom you will serve in the future, for as you are receiving now, you will wish to give in whatever context and in whatever form is appropriate for you. You must understand how people learn and how people develop. This must come from your own experience and must represent the love and compassion that are the natural emanations of your Knowledge.

      "instructions": "On this special day of practice, observe yourself throughout the day, maintaining awareness of your thoughts and behavior as much as possible. To develop this quality of self-observation, you must be as free of judgment as possible, for judgment disables you from being observant. You must study yourself as if you were someone else with whom you can be far more objective. We shall practice on the hour today. Each hour you will need to check in to see your thoughts and to observe your current behavior. This constant self-checking will enable you to become far more involved in your current experience and will allow your Knowledge to exercise its beneficial influence upon you to a far greater degree. Knowledge knows what you need and knows how to serve you, but you must learn how to receive. In time, you must learn how to give as well so that you may receive more. Your receiving is important because it enables you to give, and giving is the essence of fulfillment in this world. But you cannot give from an impoverished state. Therefore, your giving must be genuine, born of the overflowing receptivity that you have cultivated within yourself, within your relationships with others and with life. Each practice period need only take several minutes but should be given your full attention. You need not close your eyes to do this, though if it is appropriate, it will be helpful. You may practice in the middle of a conversation with another. In fact, there are very few circumstances that will prevent this moment of introspection. In practice you simply ask yourself, “How do I feel?” and “What am I doing now?” That is all. Then feel if there is something you must do that you are not doing. If there are no corrections to be made, continue on with what you are doing. If there are corrections to be made, make them as expediently as possible. Allow your inner guidance to influence you, which it will do if you are not governed by impulses, fear or ambition. Observe yourself this day.",

      "instructions": "This affirmation is so important for your happiness, for you must learn again to trust the power of love and the power of God. For this, you must relinquish your former ideas, assumptions and evaluations of past painful experiences. It is painful to be separated from that which you love beyond all things, and the only way to maintain this separation is to malign that which you love, to give it an evil intent and then to engender guilt within yourself. To feel and accept the power of God, evil and guilt must leave you. You must venture forth to explore that which is most natural. It is like breaking new ground and coming home all at once. In stillness, then, practice twice today feeling the power of God. Do not seek for answers from God. You need not speak at all but only be present, for as you learn to be in relationship with that which is the source of all your relationships, the information that you need can come easily to you to guide you, comfort you and correct you when necessary. But first you must feel the power of God, and in this you will find your own strength.",

Take special care today to see how deeply and how carefully you are practicing. Make sure that you are not changing or adjusting the lessons to meet your tastes or expectations. Remember that you need only follow the curriculum to receive its true rewards. Your part is small. Our part is great. We give the means. You need only follow them, in faith and in true expectation. In doing this, you will develop patience, discernment, trust, consistency and self-worth. Why self-worth? Because you must value yourself highly to allow yourself to approach the great gifts of Knowledge. Nothing else will undo self-hatred and self-doubt more expediently and more completely than receiving the gifts that are meant for you. Therefore, in your one long practice period today, review the past week of practice. Without judgment, look and see what has been offered, what you have done and what can possibly be done to deepen your practice so that you may receive its benefits more directly. If you are having difficulty, recognize the problems and attempt to correct them. Give the week ahead greater involvement. In doing so, you will correct self-doubt and confusion merely by directing your will.",

Your will is to know God. There is no other will. All motivations other than this are born merely of confusion and fear. To know God gives God power and gives you power as well.

How can you approach your strength when you feel weak and helpless, when you feel unworthy, if you are burdened by guilt or confusion or in anger blame others for your own apparent failures? To claim your strength means to release all that holds you back. You do not release your obstacles by claiming they do not exist. You release them because you value something greater. Their obstruction is merely the sign that you must pass through them. Your own strength is then cultivated. You seek your strength, and you use it to find your strength. We wish for you to know your strength and to utilize it on your own behalf. In your two meditation practices today, in silence and in stillness, attempt to feel your own strength. Do not let thoughts alone dissuade you, for fears and doubts are only thoughts—vaporous things that cross your mind like clouds. Beyond the clouds of your mind is the great universe of Knowledge.

It gives you the environment and the understanding to realize your true accomplishments. You are greater than your individuality, and thus you may be free of its limitations. You work through the individual that is you personally, but you are greater than this. Accept the limitations of a limited self, and do not require a limited self to be God or you will give it great burdens and great expectations and will then punish it for its failures. This leads to self-hatred. This leads you to resent your physical life and to abuse yourself personally, emotionally and physically. Accept your limitations so that you may accept greatness within your life. Therefore, in your two practice periods today, with your eyes open, concentrate now on your limitations. Recognize them. Do not judge them as good or bad. Simply recognize them. This gives you humility, and in humility you are in a position to receive greatness. If you are defending your limitations, how can you receive that which transcends them?",

In your two practice periods today, allow yourself to be limited but without judgment. There is no condemnation. Actively engage your mind in focusing on your limitations. Focus without condemnation. Look objectively. You are meant to be a vehicle for a Greater Reality to express itself in this world. Your vehicle for expression is quite limited, but it is fully adequate to accomplish the task that is yours to accomplish. In accepting its limitations, you can understand its mechanism and learn to work with it constructively. Then it is no longer a limitation but a form of joyful expression for you.",

      "instructions": "You will ask this question sooner or later and perhaps on many occasions. It is born of your expectations of yourself that you would ask this question. Yet when you look carefully at your life, you will see that you have required instruction for everything that you have learned. Perhaps things that you felt inside yourself appeared to be created by you, but they, too, are the result of instruction. You have been prepared through relationships for everything that you have learned, whether it be a practical skill or a deeper insight. To realize this engenders great appreciation for relationships and a full affirmation of the power of contribution in the world. If you were intending to honestly approach learning any skill, first you must recognize how much you do not know, then you must recognize how much you need to learn, and then you must seek the best form of instruction possible. This must apply to the reclamation of Knowledge. You must realize how little you know, how much you need to know and then receive the instruction that is provided. Is it a weakness to need a teacher? No. It is an honest recognition based upon an honest evaluation. If you realize how little you know and how much you need to know and the power of Knowledge itself, you will understand how obvious this is. How can you give to those who think they already have, when in reality they are poor? You cannot. And their poverty will be self-inflicted and self-maintained. Why do you need a Teacher? Because you need to learn. And you need to unlearn that which you have learned that is holding you back. In your two practice periods today, with your eyes closed in meditation, consider why you need a Teacher. Observe any thoughts that seem to indicate that you could do it on your own if you were smart enough or strong enough or met some other qualification. If these expectations arise, recognize them for what they are. They are an insistence that you remain ignorant by proclaiming yourself an adequate instructor. You cannot teach yourself what you do not know, and the attempt to do so merely recirculates old information and binds you closer to where you are now. Therefore, in practice today recognize your need for true instruction and your resistance, if it is there, to the presence of true instruction which is available to you now.",

Without love there is fear, for nothing else can replace love. But love has not been replaced, and true assistance is available to you.

You will be able to respond to ideas and information, even though you cannot hear the source of the message yet. This is the actual process in creative thinking, for people receive ideas; they do not create them. You are part of a greater life. Your personal life is the vehicle for its expression. Your individuality, then, becomes more highly cultivated and more joyful, a prison no longer for you, but the form of your joyful expression. True assistance is available to you.

Be very careful not to judge yourself as a student. You are not in a position to judge yourself as a student. You do not have the criteria, for you are not a teacher of Self Knowledge. You will find as you proceed that some of your failures will lead to greater successes, and that some of what you thought of as successes may lead to failures. This will underscore your whole system of evaluation and will lead you to a greater recognition. This will make it possible for you to be compassionate towards yourself and towards others whom you now judge for their successes and their failures. Review, then, the first forty-eight lessons of practice. Try to recall how you responded to each step and how deeply you involved yourself.

Allow all fears to arise and be evaluated in this way. To be without fear, you must understand fear—its mechanism, its influence on people and its result in the world.

You will realize that it is but your adherence to your own thoughts that holds you back. It is your interest in your own imagination that holds you back.

Once the world has been recognized, you will realize how much it needs you and how much you will want to give to it. The world does not need blame. It needs service. It needs truth. And above all, it needs Knowledge. Every hour today, take a moment and look at the world without judgment. Repeat the affirmation for today and spend a moment looking at the world without judgment. Regardless of what appearance you may see, whether it pleases you or displeases you, whether you find it beautiful or ugly, whether you think it is worthy or unworthy, look at it without judgment.",

This week your practice has been expanded. It has been taken into the world with you to be applied in all manner of situations, regardless of your emotional states, regardless of the emotional states of those who influence you and regardless of where you are and what you are doing. In this way, everything becomes part of your practice. The world, then, instead of being a fearful place that oppresses you, becomes a useful place to cultivate Knowledge. Realize the strength that you are given when you are able to practice regardless of your emotional states, for you are greater than your emotions, and you need not repress them to realize this. To become objective with your own internal states, you must operate from a position where you can observe them and where you are not dominated by them. This will allow you to become present to yourself and will give you true compassion and understanding. Then you will not be a tyrant with yourself, and tyranny in your life will come to an end. In your one long practice period, evaluate this prior week as carefully as possible without condemnation. Remember that you are learning how to practice. Remember that you are learning to develop your skills. Remember that you are a student. Be a beginning student, for a beginning student makes few assumptions and wishes to learn everything.",

Recognize the extent to which others are complaining about the world and how little it gives them and how little it gives the world. The world has already been condemned by those who dwell within it.

Do not use these practices to gain answers or information, but allow yourself to become quiet, for a quiet mind can learn all things and know all things. Words are but one form of communication. You are now learning to communicate, for your mind is now opening to a greater association.",

Your steps now are small, but substantive. Small steps lead you all the way. You are not expected to take great leaps, yet each small step will seem like a great leap, for it will give you so much more than you have ever had before. Allow your external life to become rearranged as your inner life begins to emerge and to shine its light upon you. Maintain your focus and accept change in your outer life, for it is for your benefit. Only if Knowledge is violated will the indication of error be evident to you. This will lead you to effective action. If Knowledge is not offended by the change around you, then you need not be. In time, you will achieve the peace of Knowledge. You will share in its peace, its certainty and its true gifts. Therefore, conduct your review in one long practice period today. Review with great emphasis and discrimination.

Small things can carry great messages if you are attentive to them. Then small things will not aggravate you. A still mind is an aware mind. A still mind is a mind that is learning to be at peace. Peace is not a passive state. It is a state of the greatest activity, for it engages your life with great purpose and intensity, activating all of your powers and giving them uniform direction. This comes from peace. God is still, but everything from God is generated into constructive and uniform action. This is what gives form and direction to all meaningful relationships. This is why your Teachers are with you, for there is a Plan. Practice stillness twice today in deep meditation. State your lesson’s affirmation upon the hour and consider it briefly. Allow your day to be given to practice, so practice can infuse itself into all of your other activities.",

You are asked to consider very deeply what they have done for you. With those with whom you are angry and upset, try to see how they, too, have given service to you in the reclamation of Knowledge. Do not bear false witness against your feelings, but in spite of your feelings towards them, if there are ill feelings, attempt also to recognize their service to you. For you can indeed be angered or upset by someone that you recognize has served you, and this is often the case. Perhaps you will even be angry at this curriculum which seeks only to serve you. Why would you be angry at this curriculum? Because Knowledge flushes out everything that stands in its way. That is why at times you are angry and do not even know why. Allow your two practice periods to be quite focused. Concentrate. Use the power of your mind. Think of those individuals who have served you. If individuals come to mind whom you had not considered having served you, think how they have served you as well. Let this day be a day of recognition. Let this be a day of restitution.",

This is directed at your personal mind, which cannot possibly understand your greater purpose. It cannot possibly answer your greatest questions or provide certainty, purpose, meaning and direction in your life. Forgive what is fallible. Honor what is infallible. And learn to tell the two apart. In your two longer practice periods today, practice letting go of fear so that you may know.

They are without duality now, for they have no other self. You have two selves: the Self that has been created and the self that you have created. To bring the self that you have created into service to your True Self joins them together into a meaningful marriage of purpose and service and ends internal conflict forever.

In time, you will come to understand a great deal more about your emotions, and you will realize that your emotions may serve a greater purpose, as may your mind and your body. All things that have been a source of pain, discomfort and disassociation, when brought into service to one power—which is the One Power—will then become vehicles of expression serving a greater purpose. Even anger serves a greater purpose here, for it shows you that you have violated Knowledge. Though your anger may not be directed towards another, it is simply a sign that something has gone wrong and that correction has to be made. You will understand the source of grief, and you will understand the source of all emotions in time. Practice upon the hour and at the beginning of your two longer meditation periods, repeat today’s idea and then enter into stillness.

You are working for the life that you will live and for lives that will follow yours. This is fulfilling to you now, for this is your gift that you have come to give.

Without purpose, freedom is merely the right to be chaotic, the right to live without external restraint. But without external restraint, you will merely act out the harshness of your internal restraint. Is this an improvement? Overall it is not an improvement, though it can lead to opportunities for self-discovery. Do not call chaos freedom, for this is not freedom. Do not think that because others do not limit you that you are in an exalted state. Realize that your freedom is to enable you to find your purpose and to fulfill it. Understanding freedom in this way will enable you to utilize all aspects of your life—your current situation, your relationships, your involvements, your successes, your errors, your attributes and your limitations—everything on behalf of discovering your purpose. For when a greater purpose begins to express itself through you in a manner that you can recognize and accept, you will feel at last that your life is being completely integrated. You will no longer be separate individuals within yourself, but one person, whole and unified, with all aspects of yourself engaged in serving this one purpose. The freedom to commit errors will not redeem you. Errors can be committed under any circumstances, and freedom can be found under any circumstances. Therefore, seek to learn about freedom. Knowledge will express itself when it is unfettered and when you as a person have developed sufficiently to be able to carry its great mission in the world. Your Spiritual Teachers, who abide with you beyond your visual sight, are here to initiate you into Knowledge. They have their own method for doing this, for they understand the true meaning of freedom and its true purpose in the world. Therefore, in your practice periods We once again affirm the power of this statement and give you two opportunities to experience it deeply within yourself. You do not need to try to speculate about this mentally, but simply relax so that it can be experienced. Focus your mind completely to allow it to experience the greatness of the presence of God that is with you and that is within you, for this is looking in the direction of freedom where freedom truly exists.",

How can you possibly fulfill yourself alone when you are part of life itself? Can you fulfill yourself apart from life? Only in fantasy and imagination can you possibly even entertain the idea of fulfilling yourself. There is no fulfillment here, only increasing confusion. As the years progress, you will feel a growing darkness within you, as if a great opportunity has been lost. Do not lose this opportunity to realize life as it truly exists and to receive fulfillment as it is truly offered to you. Only in imagination can you fulfill yourself otherwise, and imagination is not reality. Accepting this may at first seem like a limitation and a disappointment, for you already have designs and motives for your own personal fulfillment, whether they have been experienced or not. Your entire agenda for your fulfillment must now be brought into question, not to deprive you of anything of value, but to release you from a bondage which could only deceive and disappoint you in time. Therefore, accepting the hopelessness of your attempt to fulfill yourself opens you finally to receive the great gift which is available to you and which is awaiting you. This great gift is meant to be given through you into the world in a way that is specific for your happiness and for the happiness of those who will naturally be drawn to you. How can you possibly fulfill yourself? Upon the hour today, repeat this question and give it a moment of serious consideration, regardless of your circumstances. As you practice upon the hour, look out into the world and see how people are trying to fulfill themselves, both in situations that now exist and in situations that are hoped for. Understand how much this separates them from life as it truly exists. Understand how this separates them from the mystery of their own existence and the wonder of life that they are free to encounter every moment of every day. Do not allow yourself to be so deprived. Fantasy will always paint a grand picture for you, but it has no foundation in reality. Only those who attempt to fortify each other’s fantasies will attempt relationship with each other for this purpose, and their disappointment will be mutual, for which they will be inclined to blame each other. Do not seek, then, that which can only bring you unhappiness and only destroy the great opportunity for relationship for you. Upon the hour repeat this statement.

A Greater Will exists within you that wishes to express itself. When you experience this, you will finally feel that you are known to yourself. You will finally experience true happiness, for your life at last will be integrated. You must be unburdened to make this discovery. Nothing of value will be taken from you. It is not God’s intent to make you lonely and forlorn, but to give you the opportunity to realize your true promise so that you may proceed with strength and true motivation. Therefore, accept this first great offer to unburden you from the hopeless conflicts that you attempt to resolve, from meaningless pursuits which lead you nowhere, from false promises of this world and from your own idealism which paints a picture the world cannot possibly support. In simplicity and humility the greatness of life will dawn upon you, and you will know that you have given away nothing for something of the greatest value. Upon the hour repeat this statement and think about it. Observe its meaning in terms of your current circumstances. Observe its demonstration in the lives of people all around you. Observe its reality in terms of your own existence, which you are now learning to witness objectively. In your two longer practice periods today, attempt to concentrate on this idea and apply it to your life specifically. Actively engage your mind and try to think of the meaning of this statement in terms of your current ambitions, your current plans, and so forth.

When you realize how little you understand and yet realize at the same time the great offer of Knowledge that is available to you, only then will you seize upon this opportunity with great encouragement and dedication. You can only imagine fulfillment, but within you the Knowledge of fulfillment lives and burns. This is a fire that you cannot put out. This is a fire that exists within you now. This represents your greater yearning for fulfillment, for union and for contribution. Far beneath all of your hopes and fears, beneath your plans and ambitions, this fire is burning now. Relinquish, then, your ideas concerning fulfillment, but do not be hopeless, for you are placing yourself in a position to receive the gifts that are intended for you. You have brought these gifts with you into the world. They are hidden within you where you cannot find them. You do not know what fulfillment is. Happy stimulation alone cannot be fulfillment, for fulfillment is a state of quietude. It is a state of inner acceptance. It is a state of total integration. It is a timeless state expressing itself in time. How can even the happiest stimulation give you that which can abide in any circumstance and which does not cease when the stimulation is over? We do not wish to deprive you of happy stimulations, for they can be very good, but they are momentary and can only give you a glimpse of the greater possibility. Here We wish to take you directly to the greater possibility by cultivating the great resources within your mind and by teaching you a way of seeing the world so that you may learn of its true purpose. Therefore, upon the hour today, repeat today’s idea and consider it seriously in view of yourself and the world around you. Today, in your two long practice periods, once again spend time seriously considering this idea. Remember to think of your own life in these practice periods and apply today’s idea to the plans that you are aware of concerning your own fulfillment. These thinking meditations require mental work. Here you will not be still. You will be investigating. You will be exploring. You will be actively using your mind to penetrate things that you recognize exist there. This is a time for serious introspection. When you realize that what you thought you knew is only a form of imagination, then you will realize your great need for Knowledge. You must understand what you have in order to learn to receive more. If you think you have more than you actually have, then you are impoverished without even being aware of it and will not understand the Great Plan that has been created on your behalf. You must start from where you are, for in this way you may proceed, each step certain, each step forward, built upon the step before.

      "instructions": "W hy wait when the world needs you? Does this not seem inconsistent with the teaching that We are presenting? It is actually not inconsistent at all if you understand its meaning. Since the world needs you, waiting would seem to be an injustice and an irresponsibility. Is this not inconsistent with what We are teaching? No, it is not inconsistent if you understand its meaning. If you have seriously considered what We have given you thus far in your preparation, you will realize that on its own, Knowledge within you will respond to the world, and you will feel moved to give in certain places and not moved to give in others. This great response within you will not be born of personal weakness, personal insecurity or the need for acceptance or recognition. It will not be a form of avoidance or guilt. In fact, it will have nothing to do with you at all. That is why it is very great, for it is not meant to remedy your littleness, but to demonstrate the power of Knowledge that exists in the world so that you may bear witness to it and be a vehicle for its expression. Why wait when the world needs you? Because you are not yet ready to give. Why wait when the world needs you? Because you do not understand its need yet. Why wait when the world needs you? Because you will give for the wrong reasons and will only fortify your dilemma. The time of giving will come, and your life will give of itself, and you will be prepared to accept this, to respond to it and to follow the guidance of Knowledge that is within you. If you are to be of true service to the world, you must be prepared, and that is what We are undertaking now. Let not the tribulations of the world give you great anxiety. Let not the threats of destruction arouse your fear. Let not the injustices of this world stimulate your anger, for if they do, you are looking without Knowledge. You are seeing your own failed idealism. This is not the way of seeing, and so it is not the way of giving. You were sent to give, and your giving is intrinsic to you. You do not need to control it, for it will give of itself when you are prepared. Therefore, your service to the world at this moment is your preparation to be a contributor, and though this will not give you instant gratification for your need to give, it will pave the way for a greater service to be rendered. In your two practice periods today, actively think about today’s idea and consider it in light of your behavior, your inclinations, your ideas and your beliefs.",

Until this happens you will simply attempt to resolve your situation without knowing what to do, without understanding your predicament and without accepting the assistance that you will surely need in time. Therefore, accept your unlearning, for it will unburden you and give you reassurance that a greater life is possible and inevitable for you who have come here to give. Upon the hour repeat this statement and consider it. View its reality in terms of your perception of the world. In your two longer practice periods, once again practice mental stillness in silence, where nothing is attempted and where nothing is avoided. You are only engaging your mind to be still so that it may learn to respond upon its own to that which calls to it.

And would not your evaluations of yourself be necessarily in error? In this alone you have sinned, for sin is only error. Error calls for correction, not condemnation. You would condemn yourself and think that God would then follow your example and render to you a greater condemnation. That is why people have made God in their image, and that is why you must unlearn what you have made, so that you may find what you know and so that your creations in this world may be for good and have lasting value. God knows more about you than you do. Do not pretend you can create yourself, for you have already been created and that which has been genuinely created is far greater and happier than the life that you have realized thus far. It is your unhappiness that is bringing you to truth, for it is driving you to a genuine resolution. This, of course, is true. On the hour repeat this statement and consider it seriously.

Their meaning is too deep and too great to be entirely obvious to you now, yet they will serve as a reminder that Knowledge is with you and that you have come to give Knowledge in the world. Our teaching will thus simplify all things, which will resolve the conflicts that you carry now and which will make conflict in the future unnecessary. For to the extent that you are with Knowledge, conflict does not exist. An unconflicted life is the greatest contribution that can be given into the world, for this is a life that will spark the beginning of Knowledge in all, a spark that can carry itself into the future far beyond your individual life. It is this great spark that you are intended to give into the world, for then your giving will have no end and will serve your current generation and the generations to come. The blessings that you are now experiencing today in your world are the result of these reverberations which are passed from generation to generation as Knowledge is kept alive in the world. The opportunity for you to have Knowledge is born of the giving of those who have lived before, as your giving will provide the opportunity for freedom for those who will follow. This is your greater purpose in life: to keep Knowledge alive in the world. But first you must learn of Knowledge—learn how to recognize it, learn how to accept it, learn how to discern it from the other impulses in your mind and learn the many stages of development that will be required in following Knowledge towards its great fulfillment. That is why you are a beginning student of Knowledge. In your one long practice, undertake your Review in as much detail as possible.

The lessons of the world must be learned not only in your individual life, but in a life of contribution as well. Your genuine education far exceeds what you have realized thus far. It is not merely the correction of errors. It is the contribution of gifts. There are no Masters living in the world. Therefore, you may relieve yourself of the great burden of attempting or requiring Mastery for yourself. You yourself cannot be a Master, for life is the Master. That is the great difference that will make all of the difference for you when you come to understand its true meaning and benefit. In your two practice periods today, think of all the individuals that you have considered to be Masters—individuals you have met, heard of or imagined, individuals in the past and individuals living presently. Think of all the qualities that have made them Masters and how you have used them to judge yourself and to evaluate your life and your behavior. It is not the purpose of advanced students to become the criteria for selfcondemnation by those of lesser capabilities. That is not their gift, though they must understand in time that their gifts will be so misconstrued. Accept your unburdening as We remind you that there are no Masters living in the world. In your two longer practice periods, try to realize this. Try to realize the relief that is being given to you. But do not make the mistake of thinking that this leads to passivity on your part, for greater than ever will be your involvement in the reclamation of Knowledge.

It is all right to shed tears, for this does not need to betray a greater happiness within you, for these also may be tears of happiness. Happiness is not a form of behavior.

We do not want to put a veneer of behavior upon your current experience.

Think of all the ways you have attempted to be happier than you are. Think of all the expectations and requirements you have placed upon yourself to be happy and to prove to yourself and to others your worth.

The world, then, is not a prison anymore. It is not a continual source of discomfort and disappointment. It provides for you an opportunity to give and an opportunity to re-establish your true understanding. Do not seek refuge in spiritual things, for your purpose is to give to the world. Allow the world to be as it is, and your condemnation of it will not come back to haunt you. For without condemnation, there is only the opportunity to give. This will draw upon your Knowledge, which will give of its own, and you will be the vehicle for its giving. Think of this now. Allow yourself in your two practice periods to experience the presence of Knowledge in your life. Demand nothing of it. Seek not to question it. Only allow yourself to experience it, for with this all that you seek returns to you naturally without your effort. Utilize your self-discipline only to direct your mind in the proper direction. Once it is so engaged, it will return to Knowledge of its own accord. For that is its destination, that is its love, that is its true companion and that is its true marriage in life.",

Do not think you can complain rightfully about this preparation unless you are utilizing it to its fullest extent. Your role here is only to follow the steps as they are given and not to alter them according to your preferences. In this way, you place yourself in a position to receive, which is the position you now need to acquire for yourself. In your two long practice periods today, each one given to one week of practice, review the past two weeks. Try to be very kind with yourself, but recognize if you are falling short of the requirements and do not deceive yourself in this regard. Rededicate yourself to deepening your practice and your resolve, reminding yourself of the simplicity of your life and the true value that is being given to you. In this way, you will learn a new way of living. You will learn how to receive and how to give, and your life will be free of the darkness of complexity. For simplicity must always be of the light; it must always be of the good. Therefore, give yourself to this Review so that you may understand how you learn. These Reviews will demonstrate to you your own learning faculties and your own learning predispositions. They will teach you the necessary things that you will need to know in the future when you will be able to help others learn as well.",

Remember that you accept the world as it is so that you will be able to give to it, for the world is developing as you are. Remember that Knowledge is with you, and you need only be with Knowledge to realize its full impact. Remind yourself upon the hour today that Knowledge is with you and give this a moment of thought.

Therefore, realize the littleness of your emotional states and the greatness of Knowledge.

Send them love or strength or faith or encouragement or determination or surrender or acceptance or self-discipline—whatever they need to bring about resolution in their lives. You are free to give this today, for your own needs are being met. Therefore, in each of your two practices, with your eyes closed, bring to mind individuals and give to them what you know they need. Do not try to solve their problems for them. Do not try to strengthen a preferred outcome, for you cannot usually know the right outcome for any other person. But you can always give strength of character and strengthen their faculties of mind. This will give you your own sense of purpose and will reassert these qualities within yourself, for you must possess them to give them, and in giving them you realize that they are in your possession already. As you practice today, have no doubt that what you exert for others will be received by them on their own behalf.",

Remember today not to try to determine the outcome of their dilemma or their need, but only encourage and empower them to carry forth with their own abilities. You wish to stimulate Knowledge within them as Knowledge is now being stimulated within you. This giving, then, will not have an expectation of a return, for you are giving that which enables others to be strong in their lives.

As you practice today, be aware of the many subtle forms of self-pity that you entertain. Be aware of the many subtle forms of manipulation of others as you attempt to make them like or accept you according to a view of yourself that you are attempting to claim. When you are with Knowledge, you do not need to proclaim yourself; you do not need to show yourself; you do not need to control others to like or accept you, for Knowledge is with you. Therefore, do not pity yourself, for you are not pitiful. Today be a beginning student of Knowledge, for that is anything but pitiful. A greater vantage point you cannot imagine. Upon the hour, then, repeat this idea. Allow it to enter your mind and consider it for a moment. In your two practice periods, repeat this affirmation and then enter into stillness. No being who is pitiful can enter into silence, for silence is the experience of profound relationship, and stillness is the acceptance of profound love.

Because Knowledge does not vacillate, it is a source of certainty, consistency and stability for you. Because it is unafraid of the world, it is a source of fearlessness for you. You are not pitiful, so you need not pretend. Do not pretend to be happy today, for he or she who is truly satisfied may cast any expression upon the world, but within their expression will be the power of Knowledge. This is what is most important. Knowledge is not a form of behavior. It is an intense experience of life. Therefore, do not attempt to persuade yourself or others with a demonstration of behavior, for this is unnecessary. Repeat this statement upon the hour and feel its power and its gift of freedom.

You are learning to understand your predispositions—those qualities in yourself that you must cultivate and those qualities which you must arrest and bring under conscious control. You are learning to be observant of yourself. Thus, you are learning at last to be objective with yourself. This objectivity is especially important, for it allows you to utilize that which is there to serve you without your condemnation. In this way, your service to yourself becomes immediate and effective. If you can learn to be objective with yourself, you can learn to be objective with the world. This will allow Knowledge to shine through you, for you will not be attempting to make the world into what you wish it to be, and you will not be attempting to make yourself into what you wish yourself to be. This is the beginning of true resolution and true happiness, but even greater than this, it is the beginning of genuine contribution. In your one long practice period today review the past week, keeping these things in mind.

Do not try to get even with God today by ruining your relationships for your own selfish purposes, for God understands your relationships as they truly exist and understands their greater promise as well. You cannot get even with God. You can only harm yourself. Therefore, accept that you have lost the battle against God. In your defeat is your greatest victory, for God has never lost you, though you have lost God temporarily in your imagination. Your love for God is so profound that you are as yet afraid of it, for it represents the greatest power within you that you can possibly possess. You must learn of this through direct experience. Therefore, do not try to get even with God today by reinforcing an idea about yourself based solely upon error and assumption, for Knowledge is with you. You are the happy victor in your own defeat. In your two practice periods today, repeat this idea and then attempt to think about it. Our practices today will be engaging the mind in exploration and analysis. This is a useful application of your mind. Think about this message and all of your ideas surrounding it, and you will begin to understand your own current belief system. You will be able to understand this objectively. Then you will be able to work with it, for the mind is fixed in a certain structure until it is utilized for other purposes. Do not accept this structure as your reality, for the outward manifestation of your mind is a structure that you have imposed upon it. Yet its real inward harmony and nature seek only to be expressed. To enable this to happen you must have an adequate structure in the mind to enable the mind to express itself in the physical world without restraint or distortion.

If you have sufficient confidence in Knowledge, based upon actual experience, and sufficient confidence in the presence of your Teachers, based upon actual experience, this will give you a certainty and a faith in life that will counteract all fear that is unnecessary. This will leave your mind at ease. Only concern that your Knowledge is being violated will emanate from Knowledge, and then only to indicate that you need to reassess your actions and ideas. Knowledge has a self-correcting principle. That is why it is your Inner Guidance. If you are going against your Knowledge, you will be ill at ease with yourself, and this will give rise to anxiety. Much of the fear that you experience moment to moment is simply a matter of your own creation, your own negative imagination. But, then, there is fear that is born of the violation of Knowledge. This is more a discomfort than a fear, for it rarely carries with it any kind of imagery at all, though ideas can come into your mind as a form of warning should you be attempting a behavior or a line of thinking that is dangerous or destructive. Fear that is born of negative imagination comprises the vast majority of the fear with which you entertain yourself. This you must learn to counteract, for it is an inappropriate use of your mind. Here you create an experience for yourself, experience it and then call it reality. Meanwhile, you have not been present with life at all. You have merely been in fantasy within yourself. Negative imagination drains you emotionally, physically and mentally. It can be escalated to such heights that it can dominate your thinking altogether. For how else can you be separate in the universe except in your own thoughts? You cannot actually be separate from God. You cannot actually be separate from Knowledge. You can only hide in your own thoughts and weave them together to create a separate identity and experience for yourself which, though quite demonstrative, are in fact completely an illusion. In your two meditation practices today, once again enter into stillness. Today there will be no mental speculation or activity, for the mind will once again come to rest so that it may experience its reality. Let not fear or anxiety dissuade you. Remember, this is your negative imagination only. Only Knowledge can indicate if you are doing something inappropriate, and that will only be in the face of immediate events. You will find that this is quite different from negative imagination and will require a different response from you.",

To understand this, you must have great faith in the power of Knowledge within yourself and within others. As this awareness grows, the basis for your striving and desperate pursuits will fall away, making true peace and accomplishment possible for you. Individuals will come to you through mysterious means because you are cultivating Knowledge. As you have relationships with one another on a personal level, you also have relationships on the level of Knowledge. It is this level that you will begin to experience, in small increments at first. Eventually, if you pursue your preparations appropriately, this experience will grow and become quite profound for you. You do not need to seek for relationships. You need only give yourself to your preparation and have confidence that people will come to you when you need them. This will require that you assess your needs in contrast to your wishes. If your wishes do not represent your genuine needs, then you will confuse your life terribly. You will place a burden upon yourself and upon those with whom you are engaged that can only oppress them, and you as well. Without this oppression, people will be free to come to you as you truly need them.

Few people recognize this, but it is given you to recognize this through practice and experience. You can be certain that if you are not trying to fit people into your own idea of purpose, you will be opening yourself to the genuine experience of purpose itself.

As you follow this purpose, your calling in life—which is a specific role that you will be asked to take— will naturally emerge step by step. It will not require your definition. It will simply emerge, and you will understand it more deeply and more completely with each step, for each step will fulfill it even more. Your Knowledge is your purpose. Remind yourself of this upon the hour, and be glad that an answer has been given. But the answer is not merely an idea. It is an opportunity for preparation, for all true answers to all genuine questions are some form of preparation. It is the preparation that you require and not answers alone. Your mind is full of answers already, and what have they done but add to the burden of your thinking? Follow, then, the preparation given this day and each day within Our program so that you may receive the answer to your question. Your purpose is to reclaim your Knowledge, and that is what We will undertake today. Again, remind yourself of your affirmation upon the hour. Give it thought throughout the day so that it may be the sole focus of your understanding today. In your two longer meditation practices, continue to repeat the word RAHN, which will stimulate Ancient Knowledge within you.

Yet this mystery can be experienced and must be experienced. You cannot understand it at this moment, but in this moment you can experience it fully. Within this experience, it will yield to you all of the things that you now need to take the vital step that is waiting for you to take. Therefore, do not burden your mind with the requirement of understanding, for you will seek the impossible and will only confuse yourself and add to the burden of your thinking. Rather, give yourself to experience the mystery of your life with wonder and appreciation that the world is far greater than what your senses have reported thus far and that your life is far greater than what your judgments have determined.

This day remember your hourly practices and allow your two meditations in stillness to become deeper. Allow no thoughts of fear, anxiety or self-doubt to dissuade you from your greater activity. Your ability to practice regardless of your emotional state demonstrates that the presence of Knowledge is within you, for Knowledge is beyond all emotional states and is unfettered by them.

Think not that any vital aspect will be overlooked or left undone. Congratulations for your accomplishment thus far.

If you are with Knowledge, Knowledge will care for all things that require your attention. Think not that anything will be left unattended to that is for your own behalf. All needs of a greater spiritual nature and of the most mundane nature as well will be met and understood by you, for there is no neglect in Knowledge. You who are accustomed to neglect, who have not used your mind properly in the past, who have not been able to see or hear the world, can now be comforted, for you need not have concern for yourself today. For this you must extend your faith and your trust that Knowledge will provide for you. This in time will allow you to receive the gift of Knowledge, which will dispel all doubt and confusion. You must prepare for this experience. In this, you must extend your faith and trust. Be confident this day. Recognize those things that require your attention, even if they be of a mundane nature, and attend to them well, for Knowledge is not seeking to take you out of the world but to bring you into the world, for you have come here to give. Fortify your understanding of today’s idea by repeating it upon the hour and giving it a moment of true consideration. Fortify your practice today by utilizing it in your deeper practices where you enter stillness and silence. You can only enter stillness and silence if you are without concern for yourself. Thus, your commitment to give yourself to your practice is an affirmation of the safety and the certainty that abide with you.",

You are not alone in the universe. The depth of this idea is far greater than what it appears to be at first. It is a statement of absolute truth, but it must be experienced to be comprehended. Therefore, upon the hour remind yourself of this statement. Attempt to feel it in whatever circumstance you find yourself. In your two longer meditation practices, attempt to experience your complete inclusion in life. You need not think of ideas or see images, but only feel the presence of life of which you are a part.

Thus, their impoverishment is compounded by their acquisition. The world is poor, but you are not, for you have brought Knowledge with you into the world where Knowledge has been forgotten and denied. Thus, in the reclamation of your own wealth, the world will reclaim its wealth as well, for you shall stimulate Knowledge in all, and their wealth will begin to reveal itself in your presence and in the presence of Knowledge which guides you. Therefore, do not ask anything of the world save what few material things you need to fulfill your function. This is a small request in light of what you have come to give.

These duties are important, but your mission is greater. Do not undermine your ability to receive your mission by being in failure concerning your duties. This is only a form of self-avoidance. Carry out your duties specifically this day regarding your employment and your engagement with others. Do not confuse this with your mission, which is something far greater that you are only now beginning to receive and to experience. Thus, your duties will provide a foundation for you as you undertake the preparation for the reclamation and the contribution of Knowledge. Remember that all confusion is the confusion of different levels. Do not confuse mission with duty. This is a very important distinction for you to make. Your tasks in the world are specific, but your mission is far greater. As your mission begins to express itself within you who are learning to receive it, it will create a more specific influence upon your duties as well. This is gradual and entirely natural for you. This merely requires that you be self-disciplined, consistent and trusting enough to follow its steps. Therefore, carry out your duties today so that you may be a beginning student of Knowledge. Remind yourself of your practice upon the hour, and in your two longer practice periods, actively engage your mind in considering the idea for today. Its true meaning is not superficial, and you must investigate it to understand its full value. Do not be complacent with premature conclusions.

Thus, maintain your small actions in the world so that Knowledge in time may express itself through them. Actions in the world are small in contrast to the greatness of Knowledge. Prior to your preparation, the world was considered great and Knowledge small, but you are now learning that the opposite is true—that Knowledge is great and the world is small. This also means that your activities in the world are small, but they are vehicles through which Knowledge may express itself. Therefore, be content doing small things in the world. Be simple and humble in the world so that greatness may flow through you without obstruction. This practice will require repetition upon the hour and deep consideration in your two longer practice periods, where you will engage your mind actively in comprehending the meaning of today’s idea.

There is no self-inflation here, for you realize that you are small and great all at once, and you acknowledge the source of your smallness and the source of your greatness.

Practice upon the hour and in your deeper meditations, allow the word RAHN to take you into Knowledge. Silently and in stillness, as you sink into the depths of Knowledge, receive the peace and the confirmation that are your birthright.",

The fact that it is a requirement in life gives it the necessity and the importance that it truly deserves. Think not that your freedom is in any way hindered by this necessity, for your freedom is the result of this necessity and will be born of this necessity. Here you enter a world of vital direction rather than casual choices. Here you become seriously engaged in life rather than a removed observer who can only witness your own ideas. The necessity of Knowledge, then, is the importance that it bears for you and for your world. Welcome necessity, then, for it frees you from the aggravation and the disability of ambivalence. It rescues you from meaningless choices and directs you to that which is truly vital for your well-being and for the well-being of the world. Knowledge is a necessity. Your life is a necessity. Its importance is not merely for you alone, but for the world as well. If you can comprehend this in truth, this will override any sense of unworthiness or indolence that you may still possess. For if your life is a necessity, then it has purpose, meaning and direction. If your life is a necessity, then all other lives are a necessity as well. In this, you will wish to harm no one but instead will seek to affirm Knowledge in everyone. This necessity, then, bears with it the strength and the direction that you require and provides you with the grace and depth that you must receive for yourself. A necessary life is a meaningful life. Knowledge is a necessity. Give yourself to your necessity, and you will feel that you are a necessity yourself. This will dispel your sense of unworthiness and guilt and bring you back into relationship with life. Practice again upon the hour, and in your two meditation practices allow the word RAHN to take you deeper into the presence of Knowledge itself. The power of this word, a word unknown within your own language, will resonate with your Knowledge and will stimulate it. Thus, the means are mysterious, but the result is concrete.",

      "instructions": "Doing what is necessary will engage you with vitality in life, for life in the world, in all its forms, is engaged in what is necessary. This at first seems oppressive to human beings, for they are accustomed to living in fantasy, where everything is preferential and nothing is really necessary. Yet it is when something is really necessary in life, even if it is a dire circumstance, that people are able to liberate themselves momentarily from their fantasies and feel purpose, meaning and direction. This, then, is a gift to humanity, but people usually give themselves this gift only under dire circumstances. It is under happier circumstances that you must now learn to receive this and welcome necessity as a saving grace in your life, for you wish to be needed, you wish to be included, you wish to be vital and you wish to be an essential part of community. This is all necessary. It is not merely a preference on your part. It cannot be born of a casual choice but of a deep conviction, for your greater giving must be born of a deep conviction if it is to be great and complete. Otherwise, at the sight of the first adversity or disappointment, you will be cast away and will withdraw back into fantasy and illusion. Welcome, then, the necessities of this day. Do small tasks without complaint, for they are small. Follow your procedure today in preparation, for it is necessary and it is great. Do not confuse the great and the small, for the small is only to express the great. Do not try to make the small great or the great small. Understand their true relationship with one another, for within you is both the great and the small. Within you, the great wishes to express itself through the small. Therefore, carry out your mundane activities today. Do what is necessary today. Remind yourself upon the hour of Our idea for today, and give yourself to your practice so that your day may be a day of giving and receiving. In your deeper meditation practices, enter into stillness using the word RAHN to take you deep into meditation. Do this because it is necessary. Do this with necessity and you will feel the power of your own will.",

If you could but recall what you went through to come into this world and the preparation that was required—both within this world and beyond—for you to emerge here, then you would realize the importance of your being here and the importance of the Knowledge that you carry within you. Your life is necessary. There is no form of conceit here. It is simply a recognition of truth. In your evaluation of yourself, your life is either pathetic or grandiose. Yet the necessity of your life has nothing to do with your evaluations, though your evaluations can bring you closer to or take you farther from this one true recognition. Your life is necessary. Understand this and it will banish your sense of self-judgment and condemnation. Understand this and it will bring humility into your self-grandiose ideas. Understand this and your plans may then in time be adjusted to Knowledge itself, for your life is necessary. Repeat this statement upon the hour and consider it regardless of your emotions, your circumstances and whatever thoughts are prevailing in your mind, for Knowledge is greater than thoughts and is meant to govern thoughts. In your two meditation practices, allow the word RAHN to take you deep into practice. Feel the necessity of your own life—its value and its importance.

In this way, you train the mind and prepare it as well for that which is most natural to it to occur. Follow Knowledge this day. If Knowledge indicates something and you are very certain about this, follow it and be observant. See what happens and try to learn to distinguish Knowledge from your impulses, your wishes, your fears and your avoidances. This must be learned through experience.

This is not merely expressing and demanding that your personal intent be carried out. It is demanding instead that the necessity of life within you may express itself in a way that is genuine to life itself. The form and the manner of this expression will be contained in the messages that you will need to deliver to others when the time comes for that to happen. Learn, then, to feel what you know. This is a greater honesty. It requires both openness and restraint. It requires selfinspection. It requires objectivity about your life. It requires stillness and peace as well as the ability to engage your mind actively in exploration. Thus, all that you have learned so far is contributed and utilized in today’s practice. Remind yourself upon the hour of today’s practice and seriously consider it in the moment in which you find yourself. In the longer practices today, again enter stillness and engage your mind in this meaningful activity. The mind must be brought into the proximity of its Ancient Home for it to find comfort and peace.

      "instructions": "The world in its grandeur and in its folly teaches you what to value and to recognize what is true. Contrast must be evident in learning for you to make these distinctions. To distinguish what is true from what is false and what is meaningful from what is meaningless, you must have contrast in learning. You must taste the meaningless to find out its true nature and content, and you must taste the meaningful to find out its true nature and content. The world continuously provides you the opportunity to do both. At this time your need is to taste the true, increasingly, and that is why We emphasize this in your daily practice now. You have already indulged yourself in the false so sufficiently that it has dominated your mind and attention. Now We feed you the true, but you must also learn to benefit from what the false has given you. Then you will need to investigate the false no more. The false has already presented itself to you. Now you are learning to recognize its presentation and to utilize what benefit it can offer you. The only benefit the false can offer you is to learn to recognize its lack of substance so that you may desire to know what is true and have greater capacity to receive it. Thus, thank the world today for supporting you, for its grandeur and for its folly, for its moments of inspiration and for its great display of illusion. The world you see so far is largely comprised of the fantasy of individuals, but there is a greater world for you to see, a world that is actually there, a world that will arouse in you Knowledge, appreciation and true self-application as well. For it is your purpose to serve the evolution of this world, as it is the world’s purpose to serve your evolution. In your two longer practice periods today, investigate this idea actively with your mind. Apply your mind to understanding how the world has supported you. Think very carefully about this. This is not a superficial investigation. It is an investigation that you must conduct with necessity and with seriousness, for it will determine your experience in life, both in the present and in the future. Upon the hour, remember Our statement for today and keep it in mind when you view the world. Do not let this day be wasted upon you.

You are learning now to discover your greatness and your domination over the world. You are in relationship with the world. Let this relationship become healthy and meaningful. Let the world’s contribution be given to you. Let your contribution be given to the world. Therefore, thank the world once again today for what it has given to you.

Observe the development that has occurred within you these past few months—the growing sense of presence, the growing sense of inner certainty, the growing sense of inner power. Allow for the fact that your outer life has begun to open. Certain things that were fixed before have now been loosened so that they may be rearranged on your behalf. Allow your outer life to be rearranged, now that you are not seeking to dominate it for your personal protection. As a greater certainty arises within you, outer circumstances must be rearranged on your own behalf. Thus, you become a source of change and not the recipient of it only. Recognize how far you have come, but keep in mind that you are a beginning student of Knowledge. Allow this to be your starting point so that you may assume little and receive a great deal.

In the days to come We shall explore things with which you are familiar and things with which you are not familiar, things which you have recognized before and things you have never seen before. The mystery of your life calls for you because from mystery come all things of concrete value in the world. Therefore, in the steps to come, give yourself with increasing dedication. Allay your sense of doubt. Allow yourself to proceed with greater certainty. Your participation alone is required, for as you stimulate Knowledge, Knowledge will arise on its own. It will arise on its own when the mental and physical conditions of your life have been properly prepared and adjusted. Let Us now proceed with the next step of your preparation. ~ Seek experience today, for experience will answer all questions and make questioning unnecessary. Seek experience today so that it may lead you to greater and greater experience. It is better for you to ask questions of Knowledge and then receive the experience that Knowledge can give you. You are accustomed to receiving so little in response to your inquiries. An answer is so very little. A true answer must be an invitation to participate in a greater preparation, in a preparation you have not prepared for yourself but which has been prepared for you. Therefore, seek not for little things that give you momentary relief or comfort. Seek for that which is the foundation of your life, which can provide life to you as never before. Today, in your two deeper practices, become receptive to this experience. You may use the word RAHN if you find it helpful, but enter deeply into the experience of Knowledge. Do not seek for answers. Ideas will come to you in their own time and in their own way. You can be assured of that. As your mind is prepared, it will become truly receptive and truly capable of carrying out what it receives. This is the acknowledgment that you need. It must be born of great experience.

It is far greater than you can now comprehend. The extent of its relationships are far greater than you can even imagine, for reality is always greater than imagination. You are a citizen of a greater physical universe. This acknowledges not only your Lineage and your Heritage but also your purpose in life at this time, for the world of humanity is growing into the life of the Greater Community of worlds. This is known to you, though your beliefs may not yet account for it. Today, upon the hour, affirm your citizenship in the Greater Community of worlds, for this affirms a greater life that you are now beginning to discover. In your two meditation practices, once again enter stillness and quietude. This growing experience of stillness will enable you to understand all things, for your mind was created to assimilate Knowledge, and this is how understanding comes about. The accumulation of ideas and the accumulation of theories do not constitute either Knowledge or understanding, for understanding is born of true affinity and experience. In this, it has no parallel in the world and can thus serve the world that you perceive.",

You are here for a greater purpose than you have imagined, for your imagination does not contain the meaning of your purpose in life. In life there is only purpose and all the things that are substitutes for this purpose, which are born of fearful imagination. You are here to live a greater life than you have yet realized, and this greatness is what you carry within you. It may be expressed in the simplest of lifestyles and in the simplest of activities. Activities are great because of the essence that they convey, not because of the stimulation that they may arouse in other people. Understand this distinction very carefully, and you will begin to learn to discern greatness from smallness and to learn how smallness can serve greatness. This will integrate every aspect of yourself, for part of you is great and part of you is small. Your personal mind and your physical body are small and are meant to serve the greatness of Knowledge. This integrates you. This is what integrates life as well. There is no inequality here, for everything is working together to serve a greater purpose, which you have come to serve. In your longer practice periods today, engage your mind actively in attempting to understand these things. Your understanding will be born of your investigation, not merely of ideas that you find self-comforting or personally agreeable. Use your mind to investigate. With eyes closed, think on these things. Concentrate very carefully, and when your concentration comes to an end, release all ideas and enter into stillness and silence. Thus, the mind is purposefully engaged, and then it is brought into stillness. These are the two functions of the mind, which you will be practicing today. Remind yourself of your practice upon the hour and utilize this day for your development, which is your gift to the world.",

That is why it is so meaningless to consider yourself to be alone when you are part of something so great that serves the greatest of all purposes. You must relinquish your selfcondemnation and your sense of littleness to know this, for you have identified with your behavior in the world, which is little. You have identified with your personal mind and your physical body, which are little. Yet now you are beginning to realize your relationship with life itself through Knowledge, which is great. This is done without punishing the personal mind or the physical body, for they become useful and enjoyable as they learn to serve a greater purpose. Then the body has health and the personal mind is utilized, rendering them meaning which they now lack. Your physical need is for health, but your health is to serve a greater purpose. You need right utilization for your personal mind, which will give it meaning and value, for it only seeks to be included in that which is meaningful. What enables your personal mind and your physical body to find their rightful place in your life is Knowledge, which provides purpose, meaning and direction for you. This is true in all worlds. This is true throughout the physical universe of which you are a citizen. Expand your view of yourself so that you may learn to be objective about your world. Do not merely cast human values, assumptions and goals upon your world, for this blinds you to the world’s purpose and evolution and makes it far more difficult for you to appreciate that you are a citizen of a greater life. Today, in your two longer practices, engage your mind in active investigation of this idea. Spend the first fifteen minutes engaged in this investigation in both of your two longer practice periods. Try to seriously investigate the meaning of today’s idea. Then when your investigation is complete, allow your mind to re-enter stillness. Realize the contrast between active mental engagement and mental stillness. Understand that both are important and complement one another.

It is a turning point where your world gains contact with the worlds in its vicinity. This is the natural evolution of humanity, as it is the natural evolution of all intelligent life in all worlds. Your world is seeking a Greater Community. This will require that your world’s own internal community become unified. This is also a part of the evolution of all intelligent life in all worlds. You have come here to serve this. There are many levels of service and many things that need to be contributed—on a personal, on a community and on a world level. You are part of this great movement of life, for you are not here for your own purposes alone. You are here to serve the world, and thus be served in return. Today in your two longer practice periods, investigate the idea for the day. Give it serious thought, observing those ideas that are in harmony with it and those ideas that disagree with it. Examine your feelings both for and against this idea. Examine your preferences, your prejudices, your beliefs, your hopes, your fears and so forth. This constitutes the first half of each practice period. In the second half, enter stillness and silence, using the word RAHN if you find it to be helpful. Remember that both of these mental activities are necessary and complementary, as you shall learn in the future. Upon the hour repeat the idea for today.

Your humanity is without meaning unless it serves a greater context and is a part of a Greater Reality. Without this, it is more a form of bondage—a restraint, a confinement and an imposition upon your nature rather than an affirmation of your nature. Your Knowledge is greater than your humanity. Thus, your humanity can have meaning, for it has something to serve. Without service, your humanity is merely a restraint, that which confines you and imprisons you. But your humanity is meant to serve a Greater Reality which you carry within you today. This Reality is in you, but you do not own it. You cannot use it for your own personal fulfillment. You can only receive it and allow it to express itself. It will express itself through your humanity, and it will give you a greater experience of yourself. In your longer practice periods today, allow yourself to enter stillness once again, and upon the hour repeat this idea so that you may consider its true meaning.

Do not neglect small things. Care for small things so that your life in the world may be stable and may progress properly. Today, in your deeper practices, again enter the greatness and the depth of Knowledge. Because you have attended to small things, you can now spend this time of devotion and giving. In this way, your outer life is managed properly, and your inner life is attended to as well, for you are an intermediary between the life of greatness and life in the world.

This is your Inner Guidance system serving you. It will lead you where you need to be and will lead you to contribute where your contributions can be of the greatest value. If you listen to others without judgment, you will hear both Knowledge and the call for Knowledge. You will see where Knowledge exists and where it has been denied. This is natural. You do not need to judge people to make this determination. It is simply known. Listen to others so that you may experience yourself listening, for it is not your task to judge the world or to determine where and how your gifts should be given.

Yet today’s idea is really an affirmation of Knowledge within you, providing an opportunity for Knowledge to guide you and to demonstrate its value to you. It has nothing to do with dependence, for you must be independent of false things to follow that which is true. This is the value of all independence. In your longer practice periods, go deeply into Knowledge. And when you are in the world, keep this idea alive.

Becoming a true student of Knowledge will require greater self-discipline, greater consistency of application and greater acceptance of worth than anything you have undertaken thus far. Following prepares you to become a leader, for all great leaders are great followers. If the source of your leadership represents goodness and truth, then you surely must learn to follow it. And to follow it, you must learn how to learn of it, how to receive it and how to give it. Let your long review time today, which may exceed two hours of involvement, be a review of the past two weeks, keeping all of these things in mind. Become objective about your life.

For you have come to serve the world in its present evolution, and your gifts are meant to serve it in its life to come. Your world is preparing to enter into a Greater Community. The evidence of this is everywhere if you but look. Without belief or denial, things can simply be recognized. In this, life’s demonstration is obvious and need not be discerned from complexities. What makes life complex is that people want life to be what life is not, they want themselves to be what they are not and they want their destiny to be what it is not. Then they attempt to gain from life that which confirms their own idealism, and because life cannot confirm this, all becomes distressed, conflicted and complex. The mechanism of life may be complicated in its minute details, but the meaning of life is directly obvious to anyone who looks without the distortion of judgment or preference. Recognize that your world is preparing to emerge into the Greater Community. Do this without embellishing this recognition with your own imagination. You need not give form to the future. Only understand the present course of your world. In this, the meaning of your own inherent abilities and their future application will become ever more evident to you.

      "instructions": "If you can accept that your world is part of a Greater Community, which is simply obvious if you will look, then you must accept that the world is being influenced by the Greater Community, for the world is part of a Greater Community and cannot be independent of it. How the Greater Community is influencing your world is beyond your current ability to comprehend. But to understand that the world is being influenced allows you to view it from a greater perspective, which from a purely human viewpoint you would not be able to accomplish, for a purely human viewpoint does not allow for other intelligent life to exist. The absurdity of this point of view becomes quite evident as you begin to look at the universe objectively. This will inspire in you wonder, greater interest and caution as well. This is very important because the world is being influenced by the Greater Community, and you are part of the world that is being influenced. As the physical world that you live in is being influenced by greater physical forces beyond your visual range, so the world mentally is being influenced by intelligent life that is engaged with your world. This intelligent life represents forces for good and forces for ignorance as well. In this, you must come to comprehend a fundamental truth: Weaker minds are influenced by stronger minds. This is true in your world and in all worlds. Beyond the physical, this does not hold true, but in physical life this is the case. That is why you are engaged now in making your mind strong and learning to respond to Knowledge, which represents the force for good everywhere in the universe. As you become stronger, you come to understand and comprehend more and more. Thus, your mind must be cultivated in Knowledge to become stronger so that it may serve a true cause. Today, upon the hour, repeat the idea for the day and in your two deeper practice periods, attempt to concentrate on the words that We are giving you here. Use your mind actively. Do not allow it to stray and find refuge in meaningless or little things. Think of the greatness of these ideas, but do not consider them fearfully, for fear is not called for. What is called for is objectivity so that you may comprehend the greatness of your world, your universe and your opportunity within it.",

Remind yourself to be at peace upon the hour. Utilize your strength and your devotion for this. Give yourself to this. In your deeper meditation practices, using the RAHN word if necessary, allow your mind to become still so that it may enter into the greatness of Knowledge, which it is intended to serve.

With blame the world becomes misunderstood, and your mind becomes a burden rather than an asset to you. Today’s idea requires practice, discipline and application, for your mind and all minds within the world have been misunderstood, misused and misdirected. Thus, you are now learning to utilize the mind positively by giving it a true function in service to Knowledge. Do not blame the world today. Do not judge the world today. Allow your mind to be still as you look upon it. Knowledge about the world arises gradually. It arises naturally. An idea may speak of it, but an idea cannot contain it. Knowledge represents an overall shift in your viewpoint, an overall change in your experience, an overall shift in your emphasis and an overall transformation of your value system. This is the evidence of Knowledge. Do not blame the world today. It is blameless, for it is merely demonstrating that Knowledge is not being adhered to. What else can it do but commit error and folly? What else can it do but waste its great resources? Humanity can only be in error without Knowledge. It can only create fantasy. It can only engage in loss. Therefore, it does not deserve condemnation. It deserves the application of Knowledge. Practice upon the hour not blaming the world. Do not let hours pass without your involvement. Give this day to serve the world in this way, for without your condemnation your love for the world will naturally arise and be expressed. In your two deeper practice periods, allow your mind to enter stillness. Without blame and judgment, stillness becomes accessible because it is natural. Without the imposition of your condemnation, your mind is allowed to be still. In stillness there is no blame or judgment. In stillness love will flow from you in all directions and will continue far beyond what you can perceive through your senses.",

You will see that all your frustration in life is your inability to experience and to express this love which wishes to flow from you. Regardless of the circumstances in which your frustration arises, it is always because you cannot express love. Your evaluation of difficulties and dilemmas can certainly conceal this fact but cannot deny its existence. Upon the hour allow love to flow from you, realizing that you do not need to engage in any form of behavior, for love will arise naturally from you like fragrance from a flower. In your deeper practices, allow your mind to become still so that love may flow from you. In this, you will realize the natural function of your mind and the greatness of Knowledge, which is within you but is not yours to own. Do not let any self-deprecating ideas or self-doubts dissuade you from this opportunity today. Without your interference, love will flow naturally from you. You do not need to put on any pretense. You do not need to acquire any form of behavior for this to happen. Your behavior in time will represent that which flows from you naturally. Allow love to flow from you naturally today.",

      "instructions": "This statement represents your intention to have Knowledge, for unforgiveness is merely the application of blame towards a situation in which you were unable to understand or to apply Knowledge. All your failures are your own in this respect. This may look like a burden of blame at first, until you realize the greater opportunity that it presents to you. For if all failures are your own, then you will realize that all correction is given to you to apply. The failure of another is not your own, but your condemnation of it is your own failure. Therefore, any failure that engenders unforgiveness in you is your failure, for another’s failure need not engender unforgiveness in you or blame of any kind. In fact, the failures of others will engender your compassion and the application of Knowledge in the future and need not give rise to blame or unhappiness within you. Knowledge is not shocked upon looking at the world. Knowledge is not dismayed. Knowledge is not discouraged. Knowledge is not affronted. Knowledge realizes the smallness of the world and the errors of the world. It realizes this because it only knows itself, and all that is not Knowledge is merely the opportunity for Knowledge to be reapplied. Thus, your unforgiveness is simply the opportunity for you to reapply Knowledge. Repeat today’s idea upon the hour and do not underestimate its value to you who now seek to be unburdened from grief and misery. In your two deeper practice periods, think of those, one by one, for whom you feel unforgiveness— individuals that you have known personally and individuals that you have heard about or thought of, individuals that have been associated with failure. They will come to mind as you call upon them, for they are all waiting to be forgiven by you. Allow them now to arise one by one. As they do so, forgive yourself for failing to apply your Knowledge. Remind them as they appear to you that you are now learning to apply Knowledge and that you will not suffer on their behalf and they, therefore, need not suffer on yours. The commitment to forgive, then, is the commitment to realize Knowledge and to apply Knowledge, for Knowledge dispels unforgiveness like the light dispels the darkness. For there is only Knowledge and the need for Knowledge. That is all that you can possibly perceive in the universe. Your two practice periods are, therefore, dedicated to facing those whom you have accused and forgiving yourself for failing to apply Knowledge in your understanding of them and engagement with them. Do this without any form of guilt or self-deprecation, for how could you possibly not fail if Knowledge was not available to you or if you were not available to Knowledge. Accept, then, your former limitations and dedicate yourself now to perceiving the world anew, without blame and with the greatness of Knowledge.",

In your two deeper practice periods, engage your mind actively to consider the depth of this idea. You must think constructively here. Do not simply weave images for yourself that you find enjoyable. Do not simply make judgments that you find abrasive to yourself or others. Learn again through practice to become objective in applying your mind. Allow your mind to deepen its involvement.

Hold yourself back intentionally so that Knowledge may grow within you. This is no limitation that you place upon yourself. Instead, it is the meaningful use of your mind and strength to cultivate an awareness of the Greater Power within you and to allow it to emerge, to guide and to direct you. In today’s lesson, as in lessons past, you are learning to recognize the source of Knowledge and the vehicle of Knowledge and not to confuse the two. Learn restraint today so that Knowledge may grow within you. Do not think that restraint merely refers to past behavior where you limited what was genuine within yourself. No, your focus today is to learn the form of intentional restraint that represents an expression of your power and self-discipline. Your power and self-discipline must now be exercised to become strong, for your mind and body are vehicles of Knowledge, and as vehicles, they must be developed and strengthened. In your deeper practices today, as in your hourly practices, restrain those forms of thinking and behavior that betray your Knowledge so that you may enter Knowledge in stillness and in peace. With this restraint, freedom will be discovered, for freedom is found beyond this world and is brought into this world, for freedom is the gift of Knowledge.",

Allow yourself to be confused, for in your genuine confusion Knowledge may arise naturally. This, then, represents your freedom, for in freedom you are free to be confused.

Allow your Review practice period today to be engaged on your own behalf. Utilize your mind purposefully and do not allow it to wander. Break the habit of thinking mindlessly.

This, then, is the true application of your mind, for you are lighthearted with that which is lighthearted, and you are serious with that which is serious. A mind that is serious in its outward direction and lighthearted in its internal delight will be a mind that is fully integrated. This will be a mind where Heaven and Earth touch. The grace that you will be receiving this day will engender happiness and true appreciation, yet the application it calls for will require your serious engagement, your sincere dedication and the genuine application of your mental and physical faculties. Here your strengths represent your happiness, and your happiness is strengthened by the application of your true abilities. Think of this upon the hour as you repeat your idea for today. As you attempt your deeper meditation practices, seriously engage your mind so that it may experience the lightheartedness and the great joy of Knowledge. In this, you will see that today’s idea is entirely uniform in its meaning. In this, you will not confuse that which is happy and that which is serious.

This appears difficult only because your mind has been so habitually engaged with fear in the past. Habits can be broken. New habits of thinking and behavior can be instilled and strengthened. It is merely the result of applying your mind. It is the result of practice. Today practice abiding with Knowledge, which will undo all the habits that have cast themselves against you and the world. Being in life is practice and is always a form of service. Today practice the truth and serve the truth, and in this all errors are weakened. Their foundation is removed, and in its place you will begin to learn a new way of being in the world, a new way of engaging yourself with the world, and you will have a greater structure for applying your mental and physical faculties. Upon the hour abide with Knowledge. Dispel fear and remind yourself that Knowledge is with you. Remind yourself that your Teachers are with you. Remind yourself that students everywhere who are involved in the reclamation of Knowledge are with you. In this, the world will become small and you will become great.

Your thinking here merely supports or denies that which you know. But thinking you know is thinking without Knowledge, which is always mindless and engenders confusion and self-doubt. In your deeper practice periods today, do not be deceived by thinking that you know. Once again return to the pure experience of Knowledge itself. In stillness and in peace, totally give yourself to your practice today. Knowledge is an experience. It will engender its own ideas.

It begins to balance and harmonize the mind that is its vehicle, and it begins to give specifically to certain individuals in specific ways. This is the genius that is with you. How can you be poor with such a gift? Only your self-deprecating ideas and forms of behavior can engender poverty. Therefore, today begin to look more deeply at those things that are forms of obstruction to you. Think of this upon the hour. In your two deeper practice periods, engage your mind actively in attempting to discern specific forms of selfdeception and self-obstruction. Do this without condemnation, but with the objectivity that is necessary to view yourself clearly. Do not be dismayed that there are many subtle forms of self-deception. They are merely slight variations upon very simple themes. Their seeming complexity and number are unimportant except that you recognize them. They are all born of fear and the attempt to offset fear by engaging in illusion and by attempting to engage others in supporting illusion. All ideas without Knowledge serve this purpose, either directly or indirectly. Yet real purpose is the great force behind ideas that are for true service, as it is the great force behind all forms of action and behavior that are for true service. Today We will look at obstacles, but not with shame, guilt or anxiety. Look only to strengthen the presence and the application of Knowledge and only to prepare yourself to be a greater vehicle for Knowledge in the world. That is the purpose of today’s practice. Therefore, practice with true intent. You are greater than the errors that you perceive, and they cannot deceive you if you look at them objectively.",

      "instructions": "Today’s idea represents a tremendous shift in understanding. It must be born of Knowledge to have true effectiveness, however. Its meaning is not immediately apparent, for you will soon find that there are many circumstances in which others seem completely responsible for your pain. It will be very difficult, given your habitual thinking and the assumptions upon which you live, to deny that others are indeed the cause of your pain. This, however, is not how Knowledge views you, and you must learn not to view yourself in this way. Pain is always a decision that you make in response to any stimuli in your environment. The body will have physical pain if it is so stimulated, but that is merely a sensory response. It is not the true pain that hurts you. The pain that hurts you is the crown of thorns of your own ideas and assumptions, your own misgivings and misinformation and your own unforgiveness towards yourself and the world. This produces a pain both within your mind and upon your body as well. It is this pain We wish to alleviate this day. Therefore, consider today’s idea as a form of remedy against pain. If another is the cause of your pain, you have no remedy except to attack or to change the other person. Even your attempt to change them for good will be a form of attack, for underneath your altruism will be hatred and resentment. Therefore, there is no remedy for pain if its cause is beyond you. But there is remedy for all pain because Knowledge is with you. Therefore, all pain must be recognized as the result of your own decision. It must be recognized as the result of your own interpretation. You may feel that you have been wronged by another or by the world. This feeling is actually present in your mind, so it need not be denied, but you must look beyond it to its source and to the mechanism for its emergence. To do this, then, you must utilize your own faculties. This will give you great strength. You will be able to do this because Knowledge is with you and because with Knowledge you can do all things that Knowledge asks you to do. Without condemnation, the world is so relieved that it can begin to recover itself. Therefore, upon the hour repeat this idea and consider its meaning. Go deeply within it to discover what it truly holds for you. In your longer practice periods, enter stillness and peace, for without condemnation upon the world and upon yourself, the mind is at peace already.",

It may be confusing because people will not accept their confusion. They will tell lies about it, saying they are certain when they are confused, projecting blame upon others to excuse themselves or projecting blame upon themselves to excuse others. All of this represents confusion. When you realize that you are confused, then you can claim the means to regain your certainty. If you do not accept that you are confused, you will impose substitutes for certainty upon yourself and the world and thus remove yourself from the possibility of receiving your certainty. This is why you must realize that your confusion is the source of your suffering, and you must allow yourself to be confused to recognize your true predicament. Recognizing your true predicament, you will see the great need for Knowledge, and this will engender in you the dedication and the self-application that is necessary for you to receive that which is your inheritance.

That is a very simple statement of your purpose, but it is a statement that contains a great deal of depth and a great deal that must be fulfilled in time. You have a calling in this world because you were sent here to do something. It is for this reason that your mind is the way it is and that you have a specific nature that is distinct from others. As your calling emerges, you will realize why you think and act the way you do, and all of this will be brought into true balance and harmony. This will erase all cause you have for selfcondemnation, for your nature represents a usefulness that you have not yet realized. In other words, you are made specifically for something that you have not yet comprehended. Prior to this, you will resist your nature, thinking it is a limitation upon you.

Because your purpose in life involves your engagement with others, it is not a singular pursuit. It is not an individual fulfillment. In reality, there is no individual who is completely separate from other individuals because individuality has meaning only in terms of expressing that which binds and joins all life. Therefore, this day develop the wisdom and the understanding that your true accomplishment is dependent upon the accomplishment of others as well. Think not that you know who all these others are, for you have not met them all yet. Some are in this world, and some are beyond the world. They may not be in your personal sphere at all. How, then, can you proceed when your accomplishment is partially dependent upon others? You proceed by giving yourself to your preparation. The power of doing this will strengthen those with whom you will be engaged in your life’s calling. Because your application strengthens one another, you are already in relationship; you are already influencing one another. The closer you come to that point where Knowledge emerges, the closer they will come as well. The more you hold yourself back, the more you hold them back. You cannot see the mechanism for this while you are in the world, for you must be beyond the world to see how this works. But you can understand the idea that all minds influence each other, particularly those minds that are meant to be engaged specifically with one another in life. Therefore, your advancement is dependent upon your own efforts and the efforts of others. Yet the efforts of others are supplemented and strengthened by your own efforts. Therefore, your achievement is very much given to you to accomplish, and yet your achievement will join you with life and will deepen the content and experience of relationship beyond what you were formerly able to experience. In your hourly remembrances and in your longer meditations in stillness today, allow your efforts to supplement the efforts of others, which will supplement your efforts.

This is the greatest possibility for any idea—that it can be a doorway to Knowledge. This idea, then, must be approached properly. You must realize the limitations of a separated point of view and not attempt to judge the value of this day’s idea. You cannot judge it. You can only respond to it or deny it because its truth is greater than your current interpretation. Recognizing your current limitations in this regard gives you access to greatness, for without protecting that which weakens you, you may find your way to that which strengthens you and gives you purpose, meaning and direction. You are part of a Greater Force for good, for this force is joined and directed by Knowledge. Knowledge here is beyond what any individual can own. Therefore, there is no “your” knowledge and “my” knowledge; there is only Knowledge. There is only your interpretation and my interpretation, and in this there can be discrepancies, but Knowledge is Knowledge. It leads people together; it takes people apart. If it is truly comprehended from stillness and objectivity, its true direction can be discerned and followed. Take strength today as you repeat this idea upon the hour.

Here you are building your capacity as well as your desire, for each day you must practice because of the desire for Knowledge, and each practice develops your capability to experience Knowledge. You are beginning to recognize the presence of Knowledge, the power of Knowledge and the evidence of Knowledge. Remind yourself of this upon the hour and do not forget. Once again, in the depth of your longer practice periods, give yourself completely to entering stillness and peace, for this will undo all blame and unforgiveness within you and will show you the power of Knowledge, which you are now learning to accept.",

      "instructions": "With Knowledge you will know what to do, and your certainty will be so strong that it will be difficult for you to doubt it or to argue against it. Here you must be prepared to act and act boldly. If your predominant concern is protecting your ideas and your physical body, then you will be afraid of Knowledge, fearing that it will lead you to do something that will be dangerous or harmful for you. Knowledge can only be demonstrated. Its beneficence must be experienced. It can only be experienced by accepting its presence and carrying out its direction. With Knowledge you will know what to do, and your certainty will far exceed all of the pretenses you have made about certainty thus far. Self-doubt may continue in the face of Knowledge, but Knowledge is so much greater because your whole being will be engaged in the activity. Only the littleness of your self-doubt, born of your own false beliefs, can argue against it. Yet its arguments are pathetic and pitiful and lack depth and conviction. Knowledge will move within you at certain times, for in stillness it observes all things until it is ready to act, and when it acts, it acts! Thus it is that you will learn with Knowledge to be at peace in the world, and yet when you act, you will act with true efficacy and with great result. In this way, you may be a person of action and contemplation all at once, for your contemplation will be deep and meaningful, and your action will be deep and meaningful as well. With Knowledge you will know what to do. Do not think that you know what to do unless you are with Knowledge and Knowledge is indicating for you to do something with great power. Do not make small attempts at resolving your problems, for without Knowledge your attempts will be meaningless and will compound your frustration. Upon the hour repeat today’s idea and consider it. In the depth of your longer practices, utilize the skills that you have cultivated thus far to engage yourself with stillness. If Knowledge is still, you may be still as well. Thus, when Knowledge stimulates action, you will be able to act, and in so doing, the resolution that you bring will be greater than anything you could conceive of.",

The meaning and purpose of your life will simply arise and be expressed today and tomorrow and in the days to come, for Knowledge is that simple and fundamental. Thus, your intellect can be used to deal with the physical necessities of your life, the particulars of your life and the mechanism of your life, for this is the application of the intellect. Yet the greatness of Knowledge provides purpose, meaning and direction, which the intellect can never provide. Therefore, the intellect is a faculty that has a true function here, for it serves the greatness of Knowledge. You are only beginning to comprehend the meaning of Knowledge and the nature of Knowledge. Think not that your conclusions thus far are adequate to your needs, for you are a beginning student of Knowledge and as a beginning student, you will not make the mistake of relying upon your assumptions alone. For beginning students make few assumptions and are eager to learn all that is necessary for them. Be a beginning student today. Recognize how little you know and how much you must learn. You have a lifetime to learn this, and yet your lifetime must be activated and strengthened beyond what you have realized thus far. In time, the greatness that you carry will express itself through you in actions both great and small. Today, in your deeper practice periods where you enter stillness, allow your awareness of Knowledge to be cultivated further. Attend to your practice like a patient gardener who does not demand that all plants bear fruit today, but who understands the seasons of growth and change. Allow yourself to have this comprehension, for in time you will understand objectively how human beings develop and grow and what they carry within them. When you leave this world, if you are successful in cultivating Knowledge and in allowing it to give all of its gifts into the world, you will then be able to become one of the Teachers of those who remain behind. In this way, you will fulfill your learning in the world by contributing all that you have acquired in the world to others. In this, your gift is fulfilled and theirs is furthered. You are only beginning to comprehend these words. Today strengthen your experience of Knowledge so that the comprehension of these words may deepen within you. Upon the hour repeat today’s idea so that all of your activities and all of your engagements, in whatever environment you find yourself, are conducive to your practice. For there is no event or interaction which Knowledge cannot bless and harmonize.",

Nothing else can be called freedom, for anything else is merely the freedom to be in chaos and to degenerate into misery. You are free this day to allow Knowledge to abide with you.

When you have the freedom to be with Knowledge in your two meditation periods, allow yourself to enter stillness and let not any feeling, idea or thought dissuade you from experiencing the great freedom that you have to escape from the world into Knowledge.

They may speak of greater things awaiting you, but they cannot take you there, for Knowledge must be your guide to your destiny and your fulfillment. With ideas you stand at the beginning, pointing the way for others, but you yourself cannot go. When you are traveling with Knowledge, Knowledge will extend itself through ideas. It will extend itself through actions, through gestures and through all the vehicles of communication in this world. Therefore, do not be content with ideas alone. Do not think that by speculating upon ideas that you are comprehending the nature of Knowledge and its true application in the world. These things can be experienced and observed, but the individuals experiencing and observing them must be moved at the very core of their being. Therefore, do not be satisfied with little things in place of the greatness of your true being and your purpose in the world. Return to Knowledge, and be grateful for the ideas that have pointed you in this direction. But realize that the power that can move you, the power that gives you the strength to prepare and participate, is born of the great Wisdom and Knowledge that you carry. It requires Knowledge to follow Knowledge. It requires Knowledge to prepare for Knowledge. Thus, Knowledge is exercised even as you approach it. Do not, then, remain at the beginning of your journey with ideas alone. Do not accept little things in place of the greatness of your function. Remind yourself of this upon the hour and in your deeper meditation practices, once again enter stillness and peace. Come to your practice without questions. Come to your practice without petitions. Remind yourself that in Knowledge all things will be given, all things will be received and all things will be applied as they are needed. As your mind becomes more simple and open, it will become a vehicle for Knowledge to express itself in the world.",

      "instructions": "Anger is unjustified, for anger alone is merely your response to your failure to apply Knowledge. This engenders anger at its very source. But this need not happen, because anger is a response. As a response it can generate anger in others and stimulate a violent response internally and externally wherever it is applied. Knowledge, however, will redirect anger so that it has no destructive qualities, for what you wish to express is that which fortifies Knowledge in others. It is the strength of your conviction and not your desire to hurt yourself or others that is the true efficacy of the emotion that is the core of anger. Thus, it may be said that your anger is a true communication that has been distorted by your own projections of blame and fear. Once these distortions have been cleared away, the true communication that is the seed of all anger can be expressed. This can only bring about good. Anger, then, is not justified, for it is a misinterpretation of a true communication. Your anger is not justified because anger is born of confusion. Yet confusion calls for preparation and the true application of Knowledge. Therefore, the sinful are not punished but are attended to. The wicked are not sent to hell but are prepared for Heaven. This is the true nature of God’s purpose in the world. That is why God can never be angry, because God is not offended. God is merely applying God to a situation where God has temporarily been forgotten. In the greater scope of things, even the separation of all individual minds is a very temporary occurrence. You cannot think yet at this level and will not be able to do so for a long time, for you must undergo the various stages of development that integrate your mind into greater and greater experiences of relationship and life. But as you proceed and as you take each vital step that expands your horizons, you will begin to understand that anger is unjustified. It merely represents a failure to apply Knowledge in a particular situation. This calls for remedy not for condemnation. Here you will realize that your anger is something to be understood. It is not to be rejected, for if you reject anger, you also reject the seed of anger, which is true communication. Therefore, We wish to clean away that which has spoiled your true communication so that your true communication may shine forth, for true communication always comes from Knowledge. Think of this idea upon the hour. In your deeper practice periods, actively engage your mind in looking at every single thing that you are angry about, from very tiny things that are specific to things in general that upset or discourage you. Remind yourself as you review your inventory of anger that your anger is unjustified. Remind yourself that it calls for the application of Knowledge and that within each angry experience or feeling that you have, there is a seed which is true. Therefore, your anger need not be rejected but cleansed, for in cleansing your anger you will be able to communicate that which you intended to communicate in the beginning where you initially failed. Then your self-expression will be complete, and anger will be no more.",

This is the gift that gives value to all human expression, all human endeavor and all human invention that is intended to support the well-being of humanity in its evolution. Knowledge is not something that you can quantify and give, as if you put it into a package or delineate it with your ideas. It is a presence and a quality of life that is the very essence of life. It makes all giving and contribution meaningful. This is your greatest gift, which you are now learning to receive. As you receive it, it will give itself naturally, for you cannot keep Knowledge for yourself. Once it emerges, it begins to express itself in all directions and specifically in certain directions and in certain involvements with certain people according to its design and Wisdom. Thus, if you receive Knowledge, it must be given. It will give itself, and you will want to give it because you possess wealth, and wealth can only be increased through giving. Thus, in essence, life is all about the giving of Knowledge. Wherever this giving cannot be accomplished, there is all manner of deception, disappointment and despair. But when giving is reactivated in these circumstances, these qualities of denial will be dispelled, and Knowledge will once again begin to express itself in very specific ways. Therefore, upon the hour remind yourself of this great truth, and in your deeper meditations allow yourself to experience Knowledge. Allow yourself to receive it. Give yourself to this application of your mind and your body. In this, Knowledge will give itself, and you will be fulfilled because you have given life the greatest gift that can be given.",

All human ambition that is not born of Knowledge is born of the attempt to offset the grave disappointment and great anxiety of separation. The attempt to be special is the attempt to fortify separation. It is the attempt to make yourself greater at the expense of others. It always denies life and Knowledge and always leads to greater confusion, frustration and despair. You are freed this day from attempting to make yourself special, for in this way you will find the true relief that you have sought in all of your previous endeavors. What is special in you is your unique form of expression of that which is inherent in all life. Then that which joins life and is life is affirmed. Your individuality is affirmed as well, but not to the exclusion of the value of any other expression of life. Here you are not special. You are simply you. You are greater than an individual because you are part of life, and yet you are an individual because you express life individually. Here all conflict and confusion end. That which is limited expresses that which is unlimited, and that which is unique expresses that which is inherent and intrinsic. This is the resolution that you seek, for you do not really wish to be special. You only wish to have your individual life have purpose, meaning and direction. Upon the hour think of this after you repeat the idea for today. In your deeper practices, enter into stillness and peace once again. Do not petition for answers because you do not need to do this in your meditation practices. Your time now is to practice receiving Knowledge, in which your individuality is honored and confirmed for its true purpose and in which your specialness, which has only been a grave and impossible burden for you, is gently lifted from your shoulders. Do not seek to be special today, for that is not the purpose of your life. Then all fear of death and destruction will leave you. Then all judgment and comparison with others will leave you. Then you will be able to honor life and honor your relationships, which are an expression of everything today’s lesson will teach you.",

Indeed, this is your greatest gift to yourself, for as your life is demonstrated in its value to you, your estimation of yourself will be redeemed, and you will understand your true value in proportion to life itself. Therefore, when others are strong, you are honored. In this way, you will not seek to belittle another to strengthen yourself.

Throughout Our training together in these days, weeks and months, you are learning to engage your mind to recognize what is obvious and apparent, but which has not yet been apparent to you who have entertained yourself with shallow things.

For you prepare yourself not only for your own advancement and fulfillment, but for the advancement and fulfillment of humanity. This is no idle claim or statement. It is absolutely the truth. For every step you take towards Knowledge, you give your accomplishment to the world, and you lessen the burden of all who struggle with their own fantasies and sense of failure. Your life, then, becomes your teaching, for it is a life of Knowledge. It demonstrates the presence of Knowledge in the world, which is the presence of God. This happens as a result of your serving as an advanced vehicle for Knowledge. In your advancement all human capabilities are furthered, all human liabilities are dissipated and that which is most true and genuine in individual human life in the world is exalted. And that which is beyond all human life, but which contains human life, is affirmed as well. Therefore, another’s failure is a call for your involvement with Knowledge.

      "instructions": "Alone you can do nothing, for nothing in life is done alone. This is so very obvious if you simply observe the activity around you. No one is doing anything alone. This is so very true; it cannot be denied if you look upon the world honestly. Even if you were alone on a mountaintop without another soul in sight, you would not be alone, for your Teachers would be with you, and everything that you would accomplish there would be a joint effort, as everything that you accomplish with other people is a joint effort. This affirms the intrinsic nature of relationships and gives complete evidence to the fact that nothing can be done alone. In this, you must learn to value your relationships, for they are the vehicles for accomplishment in all areas and in all avenues of expression. Therefore, We emphasize the value of your relationships to you who now seek to reclaim Knowledge. These relationships must be imbued with the Knowledge that you are reclaiming. Then they will have the stability, the efficacy and the grace that Knowledge contains for you. For only relationships based upon Knowledge can carry the Wisdom that Knowledge will exert within the world. Relationships based upon personal attraction or personal fantasy do not have the foundation to carry Knowledge and will fail abruptly in the presence of the demands and requirements of a true life. Therefore, as you reclaim Knowledge, you also learn the lessons of relationships. Remind yourself of this upon the hour and witness the obviousness of today’s lesson in whatever context you find yourself. If you look, you will see that nothing can be done alone—on any level, in any avenue. Nothing can be done alone. There is no individual creativity. There is no individual contribution. There is no individual invention. The only thing that can be made alone is fantasy, and in this a great deal has been produced. But even this is shared and fortified as each individual fortifies it within his or her own imagination. Therefore, even illusion is shared and substantiated through relationship. Nothing can be done alone. Even illusion cannot be done alone. There is no escape from this. Yet the fact that there is no escape from life is the true promise of your redemption, for here life will redeem you, and all that you have brought into the world will be activated and contributed. In your deeper practice periods today, bring yourself to Knowledge and bring yourself to your Teachers in stillness and humility. Realize that you can do nothing alone. Even your attempt to discipline your mind and to prepare yourself for meditation is something you share with others who are practicing and with your Teachers as well. All power of God can be expressed through you, for nothing can be done alone.",

Do not punish yourself for errors which have no substance and which are in fact only an expression of confusion. There is no justification for error, and there is no justification for holding yourself apart. You are a part of life and you will need to rely upon your relationships with others and with life as a whole to accomplish anything, even to survive. As you think about this, gratitude will naturally arise within you, and you will realize that the ground upon which you walk and everything that you see and touch that is useful and beneficial is the result of giving and cooperation. Then your gratitude will bring forth love naturally, and from your love you will begin to understand how all things are accomplished in the universe. This will give you strength and the assurance of what you yourself must learn to do. Upon the hour remember this, and in your deeper meditations allow yourself to receive. Do not hold yourself apart from Knowledge, which waits to bless you in your meditation practices. This is when you come to the altar of God to present yourself, and here God presents God to you who are learning to receive Knowledge.",

      "instructions": "If Knowledge is not confused, how can you be confused who abide in Knowledge? To abide with Knowledge, however, means that you are not attempting to resolve things, to understand things, to control or to persuade things without Knowledge. You are not attempting to fulfill your specialness by using another to enhance it. You are not attempting to substantiate your errors by casting blame upon another. With Knowledge there is no confusion in relationships. You know who to be with and who not to be with, and there is no blame in this. You know where to devote yourself and where not to devote yourself, and there is no condemnation in this. You choose this over that, not right over wrong. You go here not there because here is where you must go. How simple this is and how totally effective. This affirms Knowledge in all individuals, and no one is condemned. Here the gates of hell are opened and all are free to return to Knowledge, for the gates of hell are open already, and Knowledge is calling to all who dwell there to return to God. For what is hell but life without God and life without Knowledge? It is life imagined, that is all. Therefore, receive the call of Knowledge, which is the call of God for you to awaken and participate with life. You can do nothing alone, and your relationships will be clear when you abide with Knowledge. Remember this upon the hour and in your two longer practice periods today, dedicate yourself to actively looking at every single primary relationship involvement that you have had. Recognize in them the frustrations and the confusion, the great expectations and the great disappointments, the bitterness over error, the sense of failure and the projections of blame. Then realize that with Knowledge none of this need be, for with Knowledge the meaning and purpose of each relationship was recognized at the beginning of your involvement and was affirmed at the end. Realize in your current relationships that with Knowledge all things will be clear, and you may proceed without guilt or blame and without compulsion or need. With Knowledge you may follow that which is precisely beneficial to you and to your beloved, for all relationships are honored and blessed through Knowledge, and all individuals find their rightful place with one another. In this, each person is honored and his or her Knowledge is confirmed. Let this be your understanding today.",

You will realize this as you review your practices, for your practices demonstrate your ambivalence towards Knowledge and the presence of Knowledge itself. You will learn in time that as you come closer to Knowledge, all things that are meaningful and valuable will be affirmed, and as you go away from Knowledge, you will enter the darkness of your own imagination. This, then, will convince you of where you need to apply yourself. This will convince you of the great presence that is with you to assist you. This will convince you that you are included in life and that your Teachers are with you. Whatever obstacle or inadequacy that you can recognize or imagine can be easily overcome with Knowledge. It is your desire for Knowledge and your capacity for Knowledge that need to be strengthened. And once this is done, Knowledge will express itself and you will be the beneficiary of life’s greatest gift.

It is when you want things that you do not truly need that your awareness of this becomes confused, and this leads you into dark speculation and grave disappointment. What you need will make you happy; what you don’t need will make you confused. This is very simple, very straightforward and very direct. Knowledge is always like that. Knowledge affirms that which is essential. Here your approach to life becomes simple and direct. Thus, you experience life as simple and direct. If you approach life in a devious way, life will appear devious to you. If you approach life with simplicity and honesty, life will appear simple and honest to you. Knowledge will indicate that which is truly needed and that which is extraneous, those things that you must carry and those which are merely extra baggage that will burden you. If you want what is unnecessary and devote yourself to that, you will lose touch with what is real and genuine, and your life will become confused and unhappy. Speak these words upon the hour and consider them. Life around you will demonstrate that they are true. In your deeper meditation practices, enter stillness once again. Direct your effort on your own behalf, and your mind will respond to your command. It is your desire for Knowledge that will let all things come to you. This confidence in life will give you the assurance to proceed. This confidence in life will give you the assurance that your life is highly valued in the world. This confidence in life will affirm that which guides life itself, for within life there is Knowledge and there is fantasy, but life itself is Knowledge.",

Trust your Teachers, for they have already accomplished what you are now attempting, and they are teaching it to you now so that they may fulfill their destiny in the world. Trust your Teachers, for they have no goal or ambition other than Knowledge. Thus, their approach to you is entirely uniform and honest—without deception, confusion or conflict of mind. As you learn to receive your Teachers, you will learn to receive their approach to life. In this, they will give you harmony, balance, power and direction. You cannot respond to honesty dishonestly. You must learn to respond to honesty with honesty. You must learn to respond to direction with a desire for direction. You must learn to respond to commitment with commitment. Thus, in your response to your Teachers, you learn how to respond. You learn to value what is valuable, and you learn to release or overlook what is meaningless. As you trust your Teachers, you will trust yourself. Remember this upon the hour. In your two times of great refuge and happiness, in meditation, return to your Teachers whom you now trust.

Remember that when individuals are without Knowledge, they can only commit error and express their confusion. They can only practice confusion, and they can only serve confusion. This, then, will teach you to value what is valuable and to recognize what is meaningless. This will teach you that you are always in service to that which you value; you are always fortifying that which you value; you are always practicing that which you value. Now you are learning to value Knowledge. You are learning to practice Knowledge. You are learning to recognize Knowledge. And you are learning to serve Knowledge. This is the demonstration that you require. Do not let the confusion of the world dissuade you, for it reminds you of your great need. How can the errors of the world dissuade you when they should encourage you? Correctly seen, they will only prompt you to give yourself more fully to your preparation now. This preparation in which you are engaged holds the promise of activating Knowledge in you. You need only follow its steps. You will not find refuge in the world. You have already attempted this, and it has failed you again and again, as it will fail you again and again if you pursue it any further. It is you who must give to the world because it is you who have Knowledge. Therefore, receive Knowledge this day in your hourly practices and in your deeper practice periods. Do not let the errors of the world dissuade you. Let the errors of the world prompt you and inspire you towards Knowledge, for this is part of the gift of the world to you. The other part of the gift of the world is to be the arena where you allow Knowledge to contribute itself through you. Here the world is blessed and you are blessed. Then you will be grateful for the errors of the world and for the accomplishments of the world, for one stimulates Knowledge and the other fulfills Knowledge.

All of your mental and physical abilities and faculties can serve to express this in whatever avenue you are destined to serve.

But to those who dwell in time with purpose, time moves swiftly and brings about this great result. Who are your friends today? Everyone is your friend or will become your friend.

You are reclaiming Knowledge, so you are paving the way for this. Who are your friends today? Your Teachers and your Spiritual Family and all who reclaim Knowledge. Thus, your range of friendship is enormous. There are many avenues in the reclamation of Knowledge, but the essence of learning is always to become engaged with Knowledge itself and to allow Knowledge to express itself through you.

Therefore, your giving must be done with discernment, and your discernment is something you must learn step by step, day by day. This is Wisdom functioning in the world. With Knowledge you must learn this Wisdom; otherwise, you will not be able to give your true gifts effectively and will misinterpret their results. Knowledge will give you that which must be given truly and will direct you to give truly.

The step you take today will be very substantial in giving you a new viewpoint about freedom, about bondage, about problem solving and about the nature of true advancement. Today think about your lesson on the hour and think about what freedom is. In your longer practice periods, devote your mind to thinking about freedom. This is a very important focal point today. In your longer meditations in particular, devote your mind entirely to reviewing your ideas about freedom. What do you think constitutes freedom? What do you think prevents people from being free? What produces a freedom that is lasting and secure? How can this be achieved? What will support it in the future? After you spend approximately thirty minutes thinking about all this in each practice, enter into stillness and silence. Open yourself to allow Knowledge to speak to you. Abide with your Teachers there. After you have exhausted your ideas, enter into stillness and receptivity. It is very important that you be aware of your own ideas about freedom because until these are recognized and adjusted, they will continue to cast their influence upon you. They will continue to dominate your thinking and thus your behavior. A greater freedom is now available to you, but you must learn how to approach it. Today you shall learn more about freedom—what you think freedom is and what freedom really is.",

      "instructions": "Knowledge will require you to be free of the past and free of anxiety over the future. It will require you to be present with life. It will require you to be open and honest. It will require you to have faith and consistent selfapplication. It will require that you not be in conflict. It will require that you have great love and respect for yourself and a great appreciation for the world. It will require that you be able to experience your Spiritual Family and recognize your true place in the universe. Knowledge requires this of you in order for you to fully extend yourself to accept it. In this way, you become free in learning to become free. You become guided by Knowledge by learning to become guided by Knowledge. Here you achieve the goal by taking the steps. There is no magic formula where all of a sudden you become free. There is no magic belief system which, once adopted, frees you from the restraints of your past and concerns over your future. You learn this true freedom by application, step by step. Thus, as you learn to reclaim Knowledge, Knowledge reclaims you. And as you learn what freedom is, you actually become free. Your part is very small and Our part is very great. You need only follow the steps and utilize them. The steps that are given will guarantee the result. A greater freedom awaits you and as you approach it, you assume that freedom and benefit from all of the qualities of that freedom and demonstrate all aspects of that freedom. Such is the nature of a perfect Plan that is beyond human comprehension. So perfect is it that you cannot destroy it if you follow it faithfully. This restores you and returns to you self-trust, self-confidence, self-love and comprehension of yourself in the world. Think upon this idea every hour today, and in your deep meditation times enter into stillness and freedom. It is a great freedom to have this opportunity to immerse yourself in Knowledge, to immerse yourself in presence and to immerse yourself in the actual substance of true relationship in the universe. As you approach this, you will know that it is your freedom, and you will know that you are becoming free to assume it. Therefore, today you will take a great step towards realizing that a greater future is awaiting you. This great step will release you increasingly from the concern, the anxiety, the pain and the disappointment of your past. This will show you that a greater freedom is awaiting you.",

Take this opportunity in your long practice period today to review all that has transpired in these past two weeks concerning the directions given in this preparation, your experiences of the practices and the overall results in your life. Carry on this Review with as much objectivity as you can, especially regarding the results in your life, many of which you still cannot assess objectively. Many things will change as you progress in your studies. Some things will fall away from you; other things will begin to build. Worldly problems will press upon you that require your engagement and application. Other things that you thought were problems will become increasingly remote and unnecessary for you to concern yourself with. Thus, your outer life adjusts itself so that you can recognize where you are to apply yourself now. Then your inner life and outer life can reflect one another. This is very important. You are beginning to learn how to learn, and you are seeing the world change as a result. The quality of your experience will be transformed in time so that all things, both common and extraordinary, will be viewed from a different viewpoint than before. You can then learn to take advantage of all opportunities and thus learn to appreciate life, even in its disappointments. Practice this in the Review today. Be very thorough in your investigation. Begin with the first lesson in the two-week period and follow it day by day. Recognize what happened in your life each day. Try to remember. Try to concentrate here. In this way, you will feel the movement of your own life. It is in recognizing this movement over a period of time and seeing how the stages of your life progress that you will realize that you are firmly on the road to Knowledge. You will then see that there will be less and less behind you to hold you back and that the future will open itself to accommodate you increasingly. This is the beneficence of life bowing before you who are becoming a student of Knowledge.",

Will you find it by trying every possible resolution that you can think of? Will you find it by worrying about it and fretting over it? Will you find it by denying it and seeking pleasurable stimulation instead? Will you find it by sinking into depression and thinking that life is so hard for you that you cannot meet the demands of your own circumstances? There is a simple answer to the problems that you face today. It is to be found in Knowledge. Yet to find Knowledge you must become still and observant and learn to disengage from fear and anxiety. Much of your life will be involved in solving problems, and it is in learning how to do this effectively, responsibly and even enthusiastically that you will achieve what you have come here to achieve. Remind yourself of this idea throughout the day and do not be deceived by the complexity of problems. Problems are only complex when you are trying to derive a benefit from resolving them or from avoiding them. When you have a preference that is governing your mind, you cannot see the obvious. As you learn now to look at each problem with Knowledge, you will see that the resolution is apparent. You will see that you could not recognize this before because you were afraid of the outcome in some way or you had anxiety that the resolution of the problem would leave you bereft and poor. You will have a different vision today. In your two deeper practice periods, abide with Knowledge. Do not attempt to answer your problems, but simply be still and receptive. Knowledge is aware of what things must be addressed and will cast its influence upon you so that you may respond to it and follow its direction. Without continual interference from you, the obvious will arise, and you will learn what to do step by step. Thus it is that you will realize there is a simple answer for all problems that face you. This will be an affirmation of Knowledge, and you will be happy that life is giving you these problems so that you may exercise your true abilities in response to them.",

      "instructions": "Problems in the world become complex when there is a difficulty that requires correction and development, and that becomes mixed with everyone’s preferences, everyone’s desire to protect what they have and everyone’s competition with each other. Thus it is that problems in the world become complex, and no matter what you do to attempt to solve them, somebody is disenfranchised. Someone is upset. Someone loses. In your societies this is manifest. But this only represents people’s fears and ambitions in contrast to their Knowledge. In Knowledge, you are willing to relinquish anything that stands in the way of Knowledge. You are willing to relinquish anything that is harmful to you or to others. You are willing to disengage from any situation which no longer proves to be beneficial to you or to others. This is because Knowledge makes true honesty possible. This is a selfless form of involvement in the world, and thus it is beneficial to all. Therefore, when you look at a problem in the world and it appears complex, it is very difficult at first to see simply what the problem is. But the solution is always very direct. It is people’s fear of this that disables them from recognizing the obvious. It is given you this day to realize that there is a direct solution to all problems that require a solution. Sometimes a solution is obvious all at once. Sometimes it must be approached in stages. But each step is very direct if you are following Knowledge. To approach problems in this way you must approach them without fear or preference. You must follow Knowledge and not attempt to use Knowledge to solve things according to your own designs. You cannot use Knowledge in this way, but you can follow Knowledge, and in following Knowledge you will follow a path of resolution. This is a path that few people will be able to recognize at first, but it is a path that will prove utterly effective over time, for it will free everyone involved and provide a means of successful self-application for everyone involved. Thus, the man or woman of Knowledge in the world becomes a source of resolution and restitution in the world. And their presence and their activities will always influence every situation for good. Do not be deceived by the seeming complexity of the world’s problems, for with Knowledge all things are simply resolved. Knowledge is not deceived, and as you learn to be with Knowledge, you will not be deceived either. Remind yourself of this idea upon the hour and in your two deeper meditation practices, enter once again the sanctuary of stillness within you. Become accustomed to stillness because Knowledge is still. Become accustomed to stillness because in stillness you affirm your goodness and your worth. A mind at peace is not a mind at war. A mind at peace is not deceived by the world.",

At first this will be very subtle, but as you continue to develop and apply yourself, the power of Knowledge will become stronger and stronger. It will be a force of attraction for some. It will be a force of rejection for others who are unable to respond to it. It will influence all. That is why you must learn to be very discerning in relationships, for as you progress as a student of Knowledge, your influence over others will be greater. You must not use this influence for selfish purposes, or your activities will be destructive to you and to others. Knowledge provides this restraint that We have spoken of, and you must exercise it on your own behalf. If you are ambitious with Knowledge, you will pose very great risks to yourself and to other people, for wisdom, compassion, restraint and self-control must accompany the development of Knowledge. If you attempt to use Knowledge for your own selfish gain or for what you think the world needs, you will lead yourself astray and Knowledge will not accompany you. Accept the restraint and development that are called for now, for they will protect you and enable you to render your gifts with a minimum of discord and personal risk. They will guarantee the wholeness and worthiness of your contribution, for it will be untainted by selfish motives. Practice upon the hour and enter deeply into meditation twice today. Repeat your idea for the day and enter into stillness once again. Allow this to be a day where Knowledge is strengthened.",

By becoming a follower you become a leader, for you are able to receive and you are able to be guided. Thus, you will teach others to receive and provide guidance for them. This is a natural extension of the gift that you are now receiving, which in time will find expression through you in your life. It is very important that you recognize the relationship between power and responsibility. Responsibility requires selfdiscipline, self-restraint and self-control. It requires an objectivity about your own life which very few have yet attained in this world. Responsibility is a burden until it is recognized as a source of protection. It is the guarantee and the assurance that your gift will find a wholesome and welcome expression within you and that you will be advanced and accomplished by the rendering of your contribution. It is very common in the world that people want power without responsibility, for their idea of freedom is that they are not beholden to anything. This is utterly counterproductive and has very dangerous consequences for those who persist in attempting it. You who are a student of Knowledge must learn to accept the responsibilities that are given to you, for they provide the protection and the guidance that you need so that you may develop appropriately, positively and completely. They are the assurance that your preparation will yield the great result that it is meant to yield. Think of this idea upon the hour and do not forget it today. In your deeper practices, think very carefully about what this statement means. Think of your ideas about power and recognize how much they need responsibility to a Greater Source in order to be utilized and expressed appropriately. These two practice periods will be times of mental activity and application. Think very carefully of all your ideas surrounding the lesson for today.

With this empowerment come the conditions for empowerment—that you respond to Knowledge and follow Knowledge, that you refrain from all motivations that are not born of Knowledge, that you become objective with yourself and your motives, that you question yourself without doubting yourself and that you surround yourself with individuals who can support the emergence of Knowledge within you and are free to tell you their own perceptions. This is essential for your well-being and development. This will protect you from selferror, which as you become more powerful will have greater and greater impact upon you and others.

Accept, then, the presence of your Teachers. Accept it upon the hour as you remind yourself that they are with you, and accept it in your two deeper meditation practices as you open yourself to receive them.

And you will find out from this experience, as it develops, that this is how you can experience life as a whole.

It is the indecision about being in life. It is the indecision about being alive. From this indecision all manner of self-imposition, all manner of attack and all manner of confrontation are created. It is from this indecision that people live in fantasy without Knowledge. Beware of ambivalence then. It is a sign that you are functioning without Knowledge and that you are trying to make your decisions based purely upon speculation, personal preference and fear. It is decision making without foundation that leads humanity astray. It is decision making without foundation that has led you astray. Knowledge dispels ambivalence, for it sets a clear direction. It is unconcerned with choices and with deliberation, for it simply knows what is correct and leads you towards your fulfillment, step by step, with certainty and abiding conviction. Remember upon the hour that you wish to escape from ambivalence. Realize as you repeat your lesson how much of your life is wasted in trying to decide between this and that, in asking yourself, “What should I do now,” in querying yourself about what is right and what is wrong and in wondering and worrying about the best choice and its possible consequences. Knowledge liberates you from this taxing and wasteful application of your mind. Knowledge does not deliberate. It simply waits for the time to act and then it acts. It is absolutely certain in its direction. It is unshakable in its conviction. If you follow this, which is God’s greatest gift to you who live in the world of ambivalence and confusion, you will find that you will have purpose, meaning and direction and that day after day they will be very available to you. In your deeper meditations attempt to give yourself wholeheartedly to your practice. Do not be ambivalent about your practice. Do not hold back out of fear or uncertainty, for you are participating in this preparation because Knowledge has called you to do so, and every day you give yourself because Knowledge calls you to do so. Thus, as We proceed through Our preparation together, your Knowledge is strengthened day by day, for it is the basis of your participation here. What other reason could you possibly have for becoming a student of Knowledge? Therefore, in your deeper practices and in your hourly remembrances, strengthen your conviction that you must escape from ambivalence. Realize the deadly cost of ambivalence. See how it keeps people lost in their ideas, denying their engagement with life. See the human cost around you. It is tremendous. Realize that with certainty everyone will find their rightful place. The world will proceed without the friction that it now must bear. In this way, all things seek fulfillment together in inclusion in life. That is The Way of Knowledge.",

Imagination is unstable, and even its brightest moments can turn to darkness in a second. Even its greatest inspirations can be bitterly discouraged with the slightest provocation. Here there is no certainty. Here there is no reality. Here nothing is trustworthy, for only change can be expected. That which is gifted and valued will most certainly be lost. That which is grim and destructive will most certainly pursue you. Such is a life lived in imagination. Such is a life lived in the isolation of your own thinking. Do not underestimate the power of Knowledge to liberate you from this hopeless situation where nothing genuine can be discerned, where no true meaning can be acquired and where nothing that is permanent and real can be realized and established. It is your salvation out of the darkness of your separate imagination that will lead you into the reality of life and will redeem you there. Realize here that even your greatest ideas, even those ideas born of Knowledge, are small in contrast to Knowledge itself. Knowledge is the great source of your Being as it is expressing itself in your individual life. Therefore, honor what is great and realize what is small. Realize that in time as Knowledge begins to emerge within you and as you allow it to express itself ever more freely, you will begin to recognize those thoughts that emanate from Knowledge and those thoughts that are merely imagined. Yet even thoughts from Knowledge, which are far more powerful and effective than any other thought that you can imagine, even these thoughts which are the seeds of true understanding in the world are small in contrast to Knowledge. Remember upon the hour the power of this idea, for it is given to liberate you from your own confusion and false assumptions. In your deeper practice periods today, apply your mind actively. Attempt to look at every idea that you hold dear, whether it be positive or negative. Look at any idea that you believe in or adhere to. Examine your relationship to the primary ideas that govern your life. Then remind yourself after you look at each one that Knowledge is far greater than that idea. Here you will realize that there is a means for you to escape the world of ideas and enter the world of relationship, where everything is viable, real and based upon a foundation that can never change.",

Thus, it appears that truth is changeable, yet the source of truth is not changeable. You who live in a world of change and are undergoing change yourself must realize that your Source is unchangeable. Realizing this you will have a foundation for trust in your Source. Trust can only be truly established when it is based upon that which cannot be changed, assaulted or destroyed. In this, your faith and trust will have a true foundation. You realize that what is changeless, which is the source of your trust and the recipient of your trust, will express itself in the changing world in changing ways. Thus, its expression will meet your every need. It will serve you in every circumstance. It will function on every level of understanding. It will actualize itself in every place of human endeavor. Thus, it will appear that the truth is changeable, for it operates in different ways in different environments, and it is recognized in different ways from different points of view. Yet truth itself, which is Knowledge itself, is ever changeless, ever loving and ever genuine. Therefore, today understand how relative and changeable your ideas are and how much you identify with that which is changeable, that which cannot stand upon its own. As your identity becomes founded in Knowledge and not merely on ideas, speculation or beliefs, you will begin to experience the permanence and security that only Knowledge can bestow. As you realize that your true life is changeless, then you will feel free to allow it to express itself in changing circumstances. Here you will escape all fear of death and destruction. Here you will find peace in the world, for the world is changing, but you are not.",

To have genuine stability in the world, you must identify with Knowledge and allow Knowledge to demonstrate its power, its efficacy and its benevolence within the world. You must experience your freedom to value it and to comprehend its meaning in the world. This is why you are a student of Knowledge. And this is why you must apply everything that you are learning in your preparation here. Remember this upon the hour as you are engaged in the world. Remember this in your deeper meditation practices where you are engaged in your inner life. In both arenas, Knowledge must prevail. In both arenas, your freedom must be exercised to be realized. In your deeper meditations, exercise the strength of your mind to enable it to come into stillness and quietude. Do not let fear or ambivalence dominate you this day.

For without Knowledge, you can only learn that you need Knowledge, and with Knowledge, all true learning will proceed. Your past has already taught you the great need for Knowledge. You need not learn this again and again. Why repeat the same lesson over and over, thinking that it will yield for you a different result? Of yourself you can do nothing. Without Knowledge you can only generate more imagination. Therefore, there is one answer to your one greatest need, and the one answer will meet all other needs that emanate from your one great need. Your need is fundamental and the response to your need is fundamental. There is no complexity here, for in essence you need Knowledge to live meaningfully. You need Knowledge to advance. You need Knowledge to realize your True Self. You need Knowledge to fulfill your destiny in the world. Without Knowledge, you will simply wander around and come once again to realize that you need Knowledge. This is a day of thanksgiving, for your prayers have been answered. Your need has been responded to. The gift has been given to you to reclaim your Knowledge. Above all else seek that which will serve everything through you. In this, your need and the remedy for your life will become simple, and you will be able to proceed in certainty and patience, becoming a consistent student of Knowledge.

It wants to keep everything it has acquired and lose nothing, and yet it wants more than it needs. It is confused as to its predicament. It is confused as to the remedy. It is confused as to its identity. It is confused as to what to value and what not to value. All arguments and debates, all conflicts and all wars are engaged in exercising this ambivalence. As you abide with Knowledge, you will look upon the world and recognize its utter confusion. This will teach you and remind you of the great need for Knowledge in the world. Knowledge will never attack itself, and Knowledge is not in conflict with itself. Therefore, two individuals, or two nations, or even two worlds, will have no issues of contention if they are guided by Knowledge, for Knowledge will always seek to join individuals in a meaningful way and to clarify their interactions with one another. It is not possible that Knowledge be in conflict with itself, for there is no opposition within Knowledge. It has one purpose and one aim, and to this it organizes all activity. It organizes all forms of opposition into serving one purpose and one direction. Thus, it is the great peacemaker in the world. As you abide with Knowledge, you will become the vehicle for its expression. Then you will teach peace because peace itself will be teaching through you. Looking at Knowledge like this will enable you to recognize your true involvement and your true responsibility as a student of Knowledge. The world is in ambivalence. It is in confusion and is suffering all of the results of this. But you who are now learning to witness the world without judgment or condemnation and are learning to witness the world from the certainty of Knowledge will be able to simply recognize the predicament of the world and know that you are carrying the remedy within yourself now. In your deeper practices enter into stillness once again and use the RAHN word if necessary to help you. Because you are learning to be still, you are learning to be certain. Any individual who can acquire stillness in the world will become a source of Knowledge in the world, for Knowledge will express itself in the world wherever there is an opening in any mind.

Because your stillness allows Knowledge to express itself through you. How can stillness be a gift to the world? Because your stillness enables all other minds to be still so that they may know. A mind in conflict cannot be still. A mind that is desperately seeking for resolution cannot be still. A mind that is turbulent with its own evaluations cannot be still. Thus, as you present the stillness that you are now cultivating to the world, you give all other minds that recognize you the opportunity and the demonstration that will enable them to enter stillness themselves. You are, in essence, communicating that peace and freedom are possible and that there is a great presence of Knowledge in the world, calling upon each separated and tormented mind. Your stillness is a gift. It will calm all minds. It will still all controversies. It will have a calming, soothing effect on all who suffer under the weight of their own imagination. This, then, is a great gift. It is not your only gift, for you will also give through your ideas, your actions and your accomplishments in the world. Here you will demonstrate the evolving qualities of mind that are required of you as a student of Knowledge. Yet of all that you may contribute to the world, your stillness will have the greatest effect, for in stillness you will resonate with all other minds, you will calm all other minds and you will be extending true peace into the world and the freedom that it demonstrates. Today remember the importance of stillness upon the hour. Look about at the world of turbulence and realize its great application there. In your two deeper meditation practices, give yourself again to stillness. Allow yourself to escape the ambivalence and uncertainty that haunt you and that hold you back.

This is where prayer becomes real and where your mind, which is an expression of God’s Mind, in stillness, humility and openness, yields itself to its great source. In this, God blesses you and gives to you a gift to give to the world which is the result of your own development. All this is transpired in stillness, for in stillness the transference of Knowledge can be completed. This is absolutely natural and totally beyond your comprehension. Therefore, you need not spend energy and time speculating about it, wondering about it or trying to comprehend its mechanism. This is not necessary. It is only required that you be a recipient of Knowledge. Do not stand apart and attempt to understand it. Do not stand apart today but enter stillness, for this is God’s gift to you.

Each day will bring you closer to peace and fulfillment. And that which haunted you before and cast great dark clouds over your mind will simply be escaped as you walk the path of Knowledge.

This will enable you to diffuse the world’s conflict, for here you are teaching peace by being at peace. This is not a false peace that you are teaching. It is born of a true association with Knowledge, for you are following Knowledge here. You are allowing Knowledge to provide the direction. You can only do this in stillness. Think not that stillness will render you incapable of genuine activity in the world. You will be active in the world, and you will participate in its mechanism, but you may be still inside as you do so. You will find, to your great delight, that you will be far more competent, more effective and far more responsive to others, with greater involvement and productivity as you carry this stillness into the world.

The more your mind becomes uniform, the more your external life will become uniform as well. How can you be at war within yourself when you are following Knowledge? War is born of ambivalence where opposing value systems conflict with each other to gain your recognition. Competing ideas, competing emotions and competing values all wage war on one another, and you are caught in the middle of their great battles. With Knowledge all of this is escaped. With Knowledge you cannot be at war within yourself. In time, all of your self-doubt, uncertainty, fear and anxiety will wear away. As they do so, you will increasingly feel that you are not at war and will enjoy the full benefit of being at peace. This will enable you to turn your eyes upon the world with the full force of your involvement, for all of your mental and physical energy will now be available for you to contribute to the world. What you will contribute will be greater than your actions or your words, for you will carry stillness and peace into the world.

A life without Knowledge can only be confused and must create its own inner guidance system, which is merely the ideas and beliefs with which it identifies itself. Thus, individuals have their own individual purpose and self-identity. These evaluations clash with those of other individuals, and thus one to one, group to group, nation to nation and world to world, war is generated and waged. In Knowledge this is not possible, for in Knowledge all are your friends. You recognize each person to be at whatever stage of development he or she is currently engaged. You may become involved with some of them, and with some of them you may not. Some of them may be able to receive your contribution directly, while others will need to receive it indirectly. But they are all your friends. There is no opposition in Knowledge, for there is only one Knowledge in the universe. It expresses itself through each individual. As each individual becomes more purified as a vehicle for Knowledge, as each individual becomes a greater recipient of Knowledge and as each individual follows Knowledge and becomes responsible to Knowledge, then the opportunity for him or her to be in conflict will diminish and eventually will disappear. Recognize, then, that all war and conflict simply express a lack of capacity for those involved to join. When individuals join, they recognize a common need, which becomes their primary need. This must be born of Knowledge and not idealism if it is to be actualized. It must be born of Knowledge and not mere philosophy if it is to lead to true action and true involvement. Thus, you become a peacemaker and a peacekeeper in the world as you follow as a student of Knowledge. The stronger Knowledge is within you, the weaker will be your fear and ambivalence. In this way, war within you will be ended, and your life will be a demonstration that war is unnecessary. Dedicate yourself today to ending war within the world by ending war within yourself so that you may be a peacemaker and a peacekeeper. Upon the hour remind yourself of today’s lesson and apply it to the world that you see around you. Apply it to all of the conflicts in the world of which you are aware. Try to understand its complete relevancy to these conflicts. This will require that you see these conflicts from a different point of view in order to realize the full impact and meaning of today’s idea. It is this point of view that you must cultivate, for you must learn to see as Knowledge sees, to think as Knowledge thinks and to act as Knowledge acts. All this you will most certainly accomplish as you follow Knowledge each day. In your deeper practice periods return to stillness and silence so that you may strengthen your ability to cultivate and prepare yourself to be an emissary of Knowledge in the world.

Try to realize that you have no choice here, for you must learn, assimilate and demonstrate your learning. This is the foundation for true teaching. Realize that your purpose in the world is to become a student of Knowledge, to assimilate Knowledge and to allow Knowledge to express itself so that you may demonstrate Knowledge in the world. In the simplest way, this is an expression of your purpose, and from your purpose a specific calling will come forth to guide you in specific ways in the world according to your nature and your design. Thus, today you will strengthen yourself as a student of Knowledge. In your longer practice periods, actively engage your mind in attempting to penetrate today’s idea and to recognize its absolute relevancy to your life.",

Be grateful to those who save you time by demonstrating the results of things you are contemplating for yourself even now. Be grateful to those who show you your own great need in the world. Be grateful to those who demonstrate what you must give to the world. Be grateful to all those who seem to err against you, for they will show you what is necessary in your life, and they will remind you that Knowledge is your one true purpose, your one true goal and your one true expression. In this, all who err against you become your friends, for even in their misery they serve you and will call upon you to serve them. Here all folly, error, confusion, ambivalence, conflict and war in the world can lead you to the conviction of Knowledge. In this way, the world serves you, supports you and prepares you to serve it in its great need. Here you become a recipient of the world’s accomplishments and are given a reminder of the world’s errors. In this way, your love and compassion for the world will be engendered. Today remind yourself upon the hour of this message and attempt to realize its meaning in the context of all of your activities so that everything that happens today will demonstrate the meaning of today’s idea. In your deeper practice periods, actively engage your mind in attempting to penetrate today’s idea. Recall every person who you think has erred against you. See how that person has served you and will continue to serve you as a reminder. This can save you great amounts of time and energy by bringing you closer to Knowledge, by increasing your resolve for Knowledge and by reminding you that there is no alternative to Knowledge. In your longer practice periods think of every person who you feel has erred against you and realize their tremendous service to you from this point of view. Allow this day to be a day of forgiveness and a day of acceptance where you recognize and extend your gratitude to those who have erred against you. Life is conspiring to bring you to Knowledge. As you enter Knowledge, you will realize the great service that life is rendering unto you, both from its accomplishments and from its failures. Be a recipient of this gift, for in love and gratitude you will turn to the world and wish to contribute that which is the greatest of all contributions. Here you will give Knowledge in gratitude and in service to the world which has served you.",

This will confirm your true destiny, your true origin and your true purpose for being in the world. You have come into the world to learn and to unlearn. You have come into the world to recognize what is real and what is not. You have come into the world to be a contributor to the world, a contributor who has been sent from beyond the world to serve here.

The truth awaits you and waits for you to be ready to value it. Upon the hour remember today’s idea and see its application everywhere as you look about at the world. In your two deeper practices, once again bring to mind every person that you feel has erred against you, and once again attempt to understand their contribution to you in bringing you to Knowledge, in teaching you to value Knowledge and in teaching you to realize that there is no hope beyond Knowledge. There is no hope without Knowledge. Today’s idea will engender love and gratitude towards the world and will strengthen this point of view, which will be necessary for you to have to look upon the world with certainty, love and Knowledge.",

Continue on in this way to cover all the days in this two-week period, and then attempt to have an overview of your life during this practice time. Begin to see what has occurred in your life in this twoweek period. As you gain an overview, you will begin to see the movement of your life. Perhaps this will be subtle at first, but you will soon begin to realize that your life is progressing rapidly and that your values and your experience of yourself are changing. You are changing fundamentally. You are finally becoming yourself. You will realize that war, which still rages in you from time to time, will diminish and become less frequent. Only with a conscious and objective overview can this be recognized, and as it is recognized, it will give you the confidence and the conviction to proceed on, for you will know that you are following your true course and your true destiny.

Thus, the Knowledge that you receive today is the fruit of their giving, for Knowledge has been kept alive in the world for you. It has been kept alive by those who have received and contributed it. Thus, their lives provide the foundation for yours. Their giving provides the foundation for your giving. Their acceptance of Knowledge strengthens your acceptance of Knowledge. The purpose of all true spiritual teaching is the experience and the manifestation of Knowledge. This can imbue the simplest gift and the greatest gift, the most mundane action and the most extraordinary action. You are in great company, you who practice Knowledge. You receive the gift of the Christ and the Buddha. You receive the gift of all true Spiritual Emissaries who realized their Knowledge. Thus it is that your participation today is given strength and foundation as you carry on the great purpose of keeping Knowledge alive in the world. Today upon the hour and in your two deep meditation practices, rest in Knowledge, which is living within you now.",

      "instructions": "Knowledge is living within you, and you are learning to live with Knowledge. Thus, all darkness and illusion are dispelled from your mind as you come to realize what your life has always been and will always be. As you realize the changelessness of your true existence, you will realize how it wishes to express itself in the world of change. Your Knowledge is greater than your mind, greater than your body and greater than your definitions of yourself. It is changeless yet ever changing in its expression. Beyond fear, doubt and destruction it abides within you, and as you learn to abide with it, all of its qualities will become your own. There is nothing that the world can provide that can in any way compare to this, for all the world’s gifts are momentary and transitory. As you honor them, your fear of losing them will increase. As you hold them to yourself, your anxiety about death and destruction will be enhanced, and you will re-enter confusion and frustration. But with Knowledge, you may possess things in the world without identifying with them. You may receive them and release them according to the necessity of doing so. Then the great anxiety of the world will not affect you, but the power of Knowledge that you carry will affect the world. In this way, you will affect the world more than it affects you. In this way, you will be a contributor to the world. In this way, the world will be blessed. Rejuvenate yourself in Knowledge in your deeper practice periods in stillness and remind yourself upon the hour of the power of Knowledge that you carry this day. Let not any doubt or uncertainty dissuade you, for here doubt and uncertainty are completely unnatural. You are learning to become natural because what could be more natural than being yourself? And what could be more yourself than Knowledge itself?",

This is a very important review period, for you will be reviewing the invocations that have been given to you, and you will be reviewing as well the potency of the task that you are undertaking as a student of Knowledge. Recognize in these past two weeks your own fear of Knowledge. Realize your own fear of the mystery of your life. Recognize any attempts that you might have made to re-enter illusion and imagination. Recognize this contrast in learning which is so essential to your understanding. Review this with objectivity and compassion. Know that your ambivalence towards life must be realized and that it will continue to express itself with ever decreasing potency as you come closer and closer to Knowledge. Remember that Knowledge is life itself, the very essence of life. It is changeless and yet expressing itself through change constantly. To experience it, you must strengthen your participation as a student of Knowledge and remember that you are a beginning student of Knowledge so that you cannot rely upon your assumptions. You must receive the curriculum and be guided in applying it. In this way, you will be safe from all misapplication, all misinterpretation and thus safe from error. This Review is very important, for you are now reaching a great turning point in your participation as a student of Knowledge. Knowledge is beginning to have potency now. You are beginning to feel its power. You are beginning to realize its total importance to you. You who have been partial with life in the past are now realizing that life is completely with you and will require that you be completely with it. This is your salvation and your redemption, for here all separation, fear and misery are dispelled. What can you possibly lose to receive such a gift? You lose only your imagination, which has haunted you, threatened you and frightened you. Yet even your imagination will be given a greater purpose with Knowledge, for it is meant to serve you in a different way. Carry on your Review with great depth and sincerity. Do not be concerned how long this takes. Your time cannot be better spent. Review the past two weeks so that you may observe the advancement of Knowledge within yourself. You will need this understanding if you are to support others in the future in reclaiming Knowledge for themselves.",

      "title": "The world I see is attempting to become one community.",
      "instructions": "The world you see is attempting to become one community, for this is its evolution. How can the world evolve when it is fragmented? How can humanity advance when it is opposing itself? How can the world be at peace when one faction competes with another? The world you see is like the mind that you experience within yourself—warring with itself, yet without purpose or meaning. The world you see is attempting to become one community, for all worlds where intelligent life has evolved must become one community. How this will be achieved and when it will be achieved is beyond your present scope, but as you look upon the world without judgment you will see the yearning in each person to join. You will see the desire for separation to be ended. The world’s pressing problems merely exemplify its predicament and call for the creation of one community in the world. This is so obvious if you but look. As you yourself are becoming one person and healing all wounds within yourself as a student of Knowledge, so is the world attempting to become one world and to heal all of its wounds and all of its internal conflicts and separation. Why is this? Because Knowledge is in the world. As you are discovering Knowledge within yourself, remember that Knowledge is latent within each person, and even in its latency it is casting its influence and extending its direction. The world contains Knowledge, too. It is a larger representation of yourself that you look upon. Thus, as you become a student of Knowledge and are able to objectively recognize your preparation, you will begin to have a true view of the evolution of the world. Here your viewpoint will not be distorted by personal preferences or fears, for the evolution of the world will simply be obvious to you. The evolution of the world is obvious to your Teachers, who look upon the world from beyond its constraints. But you who are within the world, who feel the influence of the world and who share the world’s doubt and uncertainty, must learn to look upon the world without these restraints as well. The world is attempting to become one community. Remind yourself of this upon the hour, and in your two deeper practice periods engage your mind actively in attempting to understand today’s idea. Think of the problems of the world and the solutions that they call for. Think of the conflicts in the world and the requirement that they be settled. Realize that if any individual or group of individuals opposes these resolutions and requirements, this will induce them to wage war against the world and one another. The conflicts you perceive are merely the attempt to preserve separation. But the world is attempting to become one community and regardless of the resistance to this, it will relentlessly attempt to do this, for this is its evolution. This is the true desire of all who dwell here, for all separation must be ended and all contribution must be given. This is your purpose and the purpose of all who have come here. Remember, you have been called and you are responding to your one true purpose. In time, others will be called and they will respond. This is inevitable. You are accomplishing the inevitable, which will take a great deal of time and many steps. Knowledge is your source and Knowledge is the result. Therefore, you can be certain of the final outcome of your actions. Regardless of how the world will proceed in its preparation and its difficulties, it must accomplish this one true goal. Thus, you can proceed with certainty. In your longer meditations attempt to penetrate today’s idea. Do not be complacent here, but actively engage your mind as your mind was meant to be engaged. Try to recognize your own ambivalence about the world becoming one community. Try to recognize your fears and concerns about this. Try to recognize as well your desire for one community and your understanding that this is necessary. Once you take inventory of your own thoughts and feelings concerning today’s idea, you will further understand why the world is in its current predicament. The world has a certain destiny and a certain course to follow, yet it is ambivalent about everything. Thus, the world itself must unlearn ambivalence, as you are now learning to do, and your accomplishments will assist it in its great undertaking, for this is your contribution to the world.",

You who are now dedicating yourself to give and are learning of the nature of your gift and your responsibility as a giver are setting the stage for your own freedom and securing your own freedom within the world. Do not be discouraged that the world does not hold your values and do not be dismayed that the world does not share your commitment, for there are many within the world and beyond the world who are undertaking the same preparation as you. There are many who have accomplished your current preparation who now serve the world with all their heart and soul. Thus, you are part of a great learning community. What you are learning now all of the world must learn eventually, for all must reclaim Knowledge. This is God’s Will. We are now attempting to minimize the amount of time it will take and the difficulty that will be encountered. Yet We understand that evolution must take its course within the individual and within humanity as well. Thus, Knowledge extends itself to support the true evolution of life so that life may realize itself and fulfill itself. This process continues within you and within the world. You who are claiming your studenthood in Knowledge will claim your advocacy for Knowledge. In this, you will increasingly become a force for good in the world—a force that dispels ambivalence, confusion, and conflict, a force for peace, a force for certainty and a force for true cooperation and relationship. Remember this idea upon the hour throughout the day and in your two deeper practice periods, actively engage your mind in thinking about this. Let your mind be a useful instrument of investigation. Once again review all your ideas and beliefs that are associated with today’s idea. Once again realize how ambivalence is still robbing you of inspiration, robbing you of motivation, robbing you of courage and robbing you of relationship. Strengthen your studenthood and your advocacy for Knowledge so that you may further escape ambivalence this day and receive the certainty that is your inheritance.",

If your purpose is not being served and furthered, you will feel alienated from yourself, and you will fall into the darkness of your own imagination. You will condemn yourself and believe that God condemns you as well. God does not condemn you. God calls you to recognize your purpose and fulfill it. Let not ambition take you into the world prematurely. Remember you are a student of Knowledge. You follow Knowledge in the world because you are preparing to be a vehicle for its contribution and a recipient of its gifts. This will require restraint on your part. This will require adherence to a greater preparation. A student need only follow the guidance of the instruction. A student need only trust in the power of the instructor. Your Knowledge will confirm this and will dispel your uncertainty here, for your Knowledge is returning to its Home and to its Source. It is returning to that to which it must return. It is responding to that which it must fulfill in the world. Do not hate the world or resist it, for it is the place where you will fulfill your destiny. Thus, it deserves your gratitude and appreciation. Yet also remember to respect the power of its confusion and its inducements. Here you must be strong with Knowledge, and though you appreciate the world for strengthening your resolution for Knowledge, you also take note of the world’s confusion and enter into the world carefully, with discernment and adherence to Knowledge. All of these are important, and We will remind you of them as We proceed, for they are essential for you to learn Wisdom as a student.

Some of your personal problems you will need to attend to specifically, but even here you will find that their weight upon you will diminish as you enter into a greater arena of participation in life.

Therefore, small details and great details, small adjustments and great adjustments are all included. Nothing is left out. You yourself could not possibly balance your preparation in this respect, for you would not know how to establish your priorities between what is great and what is small. Your attempt to do so would merely push you deeper into confusion and frustration. Be grateful, then, that you have been spared from attempting the impossible for yourself, for what is real is given to you. What you must do is become a student and a vehicle for Knowledge. This will activate all meaningful individual development and all meaningful individual education. It will require more of you than you have required of yourself, and all that it requires will be fulfilled and will yield its true promise for you. Upon the hour remind yourself of this and take heart that a greater involvement is promised which will provide you escape from your individual misery. In your deeper practice periods today, actively engage your mind to review all of your small personal problems. Review all of the things you think hold you back and all of the things you think you must resolve for yourself. As you look at each one objectively, without denial, remember and remind yourself that a greater calling is given you which will correct these things or make their correction unnecessary. Remind yourself that Knowledge will provide correction at all levels as your life becomes uniform and directed, as your Knowledge begins to emerge and as your true sense of self begins to be recognized and received.",

Have confidence that all problems you perceive— great and small, within yourself and without—will be resolved through Knowledge. Remind yourself as well that this does not put you in a passive state.

Allow yourself to take inventory of your thoughts and beliefs so that you may come to recognize the work that must be accomplished within you.

You who are now learning to give up self-condemnation and to escape ambivalence will see the efficacy of your own Inner Guidance casting its spark of life upon the world. Thus, you become a part of the force for good, a force that is serving a Greater Power in the world. The world demonstrates its errors with gravity and magnitude, but these errors are offset by the presence of a Greater Power in the world. Without this Greater Power, humanity would not have evolved this far. Without this Greater Power, all that has been good in your manifestations, all that has served and inspired humanity and all that has spoken of the greatness of Knowledge, directly or indirectly, would not have occurred. The Greater Power in the world has allowed the evolution of humanity to continue and has kept Knowledge alive in the world through individuals such as yourself who, through the spark of their own Knowledge, have been called into preparation so that Knowledge may be reclaimed and expressed and thus kept alive. Therefore, have hope because a Greater Power is in the world. But do not think that this makes you passive. Do not think that this lifts from your shoulders the responsibility that always accompanies the reclamation of Knowledge. This Greater Power in the world requires that you be prepared to receive it and to express it. Your voice is its voice; your hands are its hands; your eyes are its eyes; your ears are its ears; your movement is its movement. It relies upon your preparation and upon your demonstration, as you rely upon it for certainty and as you rely upon it for purpose, meaning and direction. Thus, it is through your reliance upon Knowledge and Knowledge’s reliance upon you that your union with Knowledge is made complete. Upon the hour remind yourself that a Greater Power is at work in the world. Think of this as you look upon the world in its ambivalence and error. Think of this when you look upon the world in its magnificence and its inspiring expression. If you will but look without judgment, you will see the amazing presence of Knowledge in the world. This will give you confidence in the world as you are now learning to have confidence in yourself. In your deeper practice periods today, re-enter your sanctuary where you come to give yourself to a Greater Power that is in the world and that is within yourself. Allow your mind to be still so that you may receive and experience this Greater Power in your life. Here you learn to receive that which receives you. Here you learn to recognize that which receives the world and which gives the world its only true hope.",

      "title": "Why should I be afraid when a Greater Power is in the world?",
      "instructions": "Whenever you fall into the darkness of fear, you are withdrawing from Knowledge and entering the darkness of imagination. Whenever you fall into the darkness of your own fear, you are denying the reality of a Greater Power in the world and are thus losing its beneficence for yourself. Whenever you fall into the darkness of your own fear, you are following the teaching of fear, which runs rampant in the world. You are allowing yourself to be a student of fear. You are allowing yourself to be governed by fear. Recognize this and you will realize that this need not be, that you have the power to redirect your studenthood and that you have the ability to re-enter true preparation. Think of this seriously today. Why should you be afraid when a Greater Power is in the world? This Greater Power which you are now learning to receive is the source of your redemption. What can you possibly lose as this source becomes recognized, as you learn to come into relationship with this source and as you serve this source and allow it to serve you? What can the world take from you when the source of Knowledge is within you? What can the world do to itself when the source of Knowledge is within the world? This awareness calls for your complete participation in the world and your complete service to Knowledge. It calls for your complete engagement in contributing to others because you are a vehicle for the Greater Power in the world. Yet in this active participation you understand as well that it is only a matter of time before all minds awaken to the light of Knowledge within themselves. This can take a very long time, but time is with you and in patience and in confidence you may proceed, for what can undermine your preparation and your contribution but self-doubt and fear? What can dissuade you from proceeding with certainty and complete engagement but the doubt that Knowledge exists in the world? Therefore, whenever you enter into fear, practice this day recognizing that a Greater Power is in the world. Utilize this recognition to bring yourself out of fear by remembering that a Greater Power is in the world and by remembering that a Greater Power is in your life. Think about this on the hour and in your two deeper meditation practices, re-enter your sanctuary where in stillness and in confidence you receive the Greater Power that is in the world. Here you must realize that your preparation requires that you step away from fear and darkness and that you step forward into the light of truth. These two activities will confirm your nature and will betray nothing that is real within you or within the world. As you look upon the world without judgment and as you look upon yourself without judgment, you will see that a Greater Power is at work. This will restore happiness to you, for you will realize that you have brought your Ancient Home with you and your Ancient Home is here as well. This will lift the burden of fear, the oppression of anxiety and the confusion of ambivalence from your mind. Then you will remember why you have come, and you will devote your life to contributing that which you have come to give. Then your life will be a statement of happiness and inclusion, and all who see you will remember that they too have come from your Ancient Home.",

      "instructions": "When the world does not oppress you, you are free to work in the world. When the world does not intimidate you, you are free to work in the world. When you recognize that the world is a place calling for your contribution, you are free to work in the world. Thus, the greater your experience of Knowledge within your life, the freer you are to work within the world. And work within the world you will in time, and your work will be far more effective, far more engaging and far more complete than anything you have done thus far. In your past you have been afraid of the world, intimidated by the world, angered by the world and depressed by the world. Therefore, your past contribution to the world has been limited by these reactions. You have been ambivalent about being in the world because you were afraid of the world. Perhaps you have sought refuge in spiritual things, but your true spiritual nature will redirect you into the world and bring you back with greater power, certainty and purpose, for you have come to be in the world. Understanding this, you will again realize the importance of Knowledge. You will again confirm how much you want to give to the world and how painful it is for you when this giving is obstructed or withheld. You have come to work in the world, and you want to do this completely so that when you leave, you leave with your gifts given and with everything presented. You have nothing to take Home with you from the world except the reclamation of relationships. With this understanding, you will become free to be in the world. Upon the hour repeat today’s idea and recognize that to whatever extent you are still ambivalent about being in the world, your ambivalence is caused and is being perpetuated by your own intimidation and fear of the world. Remember this upon the hour so that you may learn the great lesson that is being taught today, the great lesson that you are becoming free to be in the world. Here you bring your Ancient Home with you. Here you will not attempt to escape the world simply because it frightens you, threatens you or depresses you. You are here to give to the world, for Knowledge is greater than the world—the world only being a temporary place where Knowledge has been temporarily forgotten. In this, you will realize that which gives and that which receives, that which is great and that which is small. Your work in the world can now have your complete attention and devotion. Your work can now have your complete engagement. Thus, your physical life can become fully meaningful, purposeful and filled with value. In your two deep meditation practices today, rekindle the fire of Knowledge within you by re-entering your sanctuary. Remember to be still. Remember to give yourself to practice. This is the work at hand. From this work your work in the world will be given freedom to express itself, and you who are within the world will be given the certainty and the comfort that your Ancient Home is with you.",

      "instructions": "Truly the world is awaiting your contribution, but remember your contribution will express itself in all things you do, great and small. So do not imagine for yourself a role that is grandiose or that will be devastatingly difficult. That is not The Way of Knowledge. Knowledge will express itself through all of your activities, for it is a presence you carry with you. As your mind and your life become free of conflict, this presence will express itself increasingly through you, and you will be a witness of Knowledge at work, both within yourself and within your life. Here you will begin to understand what it means to bring Knowledge into the world. Your imagination has painted grandiose pictures and devastating nightmares for you. It is not in harmony with life. It exaggerates life in its hope and in its fear. It exaggerates your sense of yourself, primarily to your own self-deprecation. When your imagination is redirected by Knowledge, it will engage itself in an entirely new way. It will serve an entirely new purpose. Then you will be able to be free, and your imagination will not betray you. The world is calling for you. You are now preparing. In its great need you recognize your great contribution. But remember always that your contribution gives of itself, and your desire to have it give of itself is your desire to give. Your desire to have your life become a vehicle of expression is your desire to have your life become unfettered by conflict and ambivalence. Your desire to give is your desire to become free and whole. This is your desire—to have your life be a vehicle for Knowledge. Your task, then, is great but not as great as your imagination might indicate, for your task is to perfect your vehicle so that Knowledge may express itself freely. You do not have to wonder or imagine how this can be done, for it is being done today and will be done tomorrow. As you follow the steps within your current preparation and as you learn to follow the steps beyond this preparation, you will see you need but follow the steps as they are given to proceed. Upon the hour remind yourself of your lesson and do not forget. Look upon the world and realize that it is calling for you to contribute. In your deeper meditations, re-enter your sanctuary in stillness and in receptivity. In doing so, realize that Knowledge needs you to become its vehicle. It needs you to become its recipient. It needs to fulfill itself through you. Thus, you and Knowledge are fulfilled together. Upon the hour and in your deeper practices today, realize the importance of your role. Realize as well that all true assistance is given to you to prepare and will abide with you in your contribution as you learn to express Knowledge and to allow Knowledge to express itself through you.",

Carry this forward for all the days in this twoweek period. Be objective and recognize where your practice could have become deeper or more conscientious. Recognize how you still let the world overtake you and how you need to reapply yourself with greater certainty and determination. Do this objectively. Condemnation will only discourage you and will only lead you to quit your participation, for condemnation is simply the decision not to participate and the justification for not participating. Therefore, do not fall into this habit, but view your participation objectively. Here you will learn how to learn, and you will learn how to prepare yourself and govern yourself. You must choose to participate, and you must choose to deepen your participation. Every decision you make on behalf of Knowledge is supported by the decisions of all others who are making the same decision and by the power and the presence of your Teachers who are with you. Thus, your decision for Knowledge, whenever it is made and supported, is greatly amplified by the presence of all who practice with you and by the presence of your Spiritual Teachers. This is certainly adequate to overcome any obstacle you view within yourself or within your world. The power of decision is given to you. Here the power of decision is to view your participation objectively and to recognize where it can be deepened and strengthened. Resolve within the next two weeks of practice to carry forth what you have recognized as necessary this day. Here you will be acting powerfully on your own behalf, and the application of your power will be in the service of Knowledge, for you are preparing to receive Knowledge.

Carry forth that which you need to do to deepen your practice, to utilize your practice, to utilize your experience in the world for practice, to carry your practice into the world and to allow your world to support your practice. Do not neglect this, for if you neglect this, you but neglect yourself, your certainty, your fulfillment and your happiness. Do not neglect the preparation that is underway now. Every day you strengthen this, and as you do this every day you advocate Knowledge. You advocate your participation in life. Indeed, even in your preparation now you are teaching Knowledge, and you are strengthening Knowledge in the world. Perhaps you cannot yet see this, but in time this will become so evident to you that you will learn to value every moment, every encounter with another, every thought and every breath. You will value every experience in life because you will be present to them, and you will realize that within each, you can express Knowledge and experience Knowledge expressing itself. Remember upon the hour today. Make this dedication, at the beginning of today and at the beginning of all the days to follow, to utilize your steps as completely as possible. In your two deeper practice periods, re-enter stillness to refresh your mind. Strengthen your ability and your resolution to allow your mind to become still and receptive. This you must fortify each day, for this is part of your practice. This you must give yourself to each day, for this is how you give to yourself and to the world. Do not underestimate the importance of your role, but do not burden yourself with thinking that your role is beyond your grasp, for what could be more natural to you than to fulfill the role for which you have come? What could be more fully confirming of the importance and the value of your life than to carry forth what your life was meant to be? The power of decision is given you today to strengthen and to apply, yet the Greater Power behind your decision is greater even than your decision. This Greater Power abides with you now.

There is not one person in the world who, through their accomplishments or their errors, cannot confirm the importance of Knowledge and cannot demonstrate its need in the world.

      "instructions": "Therefore, I must be attentive. The world is emerging into the Greater Community of worlds. How can you recognize this if you are preoccupied with your own concerns, your own hopes and your own ambitions? How can you recognize what is happening in your world? How can you see those forces that are influencing your outer life and that govern your affairs to such a great extent? Part of becoming strong with Knowledge is becoming attentive. You can only become attentive if your mind is not preoccupied with its own imaginings and fantasies. The world is preparing to emerge into the Greater Community of worlds, and this underlies its evolution and all of its advancements now. That is why conflict is erupting in the world, because those who oppose the evolution of the world will fight against it. Those who wish to further the advancement of the world will attempt to fortify the goodness of humanity and the sense that humanity is one community that must nurture and support itself beyond all division of nation, race, religion, culture and tribe. Thus it is that you who are becoming a representative and recipient of Knowledge will fortify peace, unity, understanding and compassion in the world. All this is part of the preparation of the world to emerge into the Greater Community of worlds, because this represents the evolution of the world. This represents Knowledge within the world. Knowledge within the world does not foster conflict in any way. It does not promote hatred or division. It does not promote anything that is divisive or anything that is cruel or destructive. It is the collective experience of Knowledge in the world that moves the world towards union and community. Because your world is part of a Greater Community, it is moving towards union and community because of its own evolution and because it is responding to the Greater Community of which it is a part. You cannot know the importance of this idea unless you can be attentive to the world, and you cannot know the importance of this to you who have come to serve this emergence unless you become attentive to yourself. Remember once again that you can only lose contact with yourself if you re-enter imagination or fantasy, because this is the only alternative to being attentive to yourself and your world. Awake from your dreams, then, and become attentive. Remember upon the hour to look upon the world without judgment, and you will see that the world is attempting to become one community, for it seeks to extend itself into the Greater Community. The Greater Community represents a community that is calling upon humanity to enter and to participate. You cannot understand the mechanism for this, for it is far too great for your eyes and for your mental capacity now, but the movement of this is so obvious and apparent if you will but look. Upon the hour look, and in your deeper meditation practices, actively engage your mind in considering this idea. Today’s practice is not a practice in stillness, but a practice in active and useful engagement of your mind. Consider your own response to today’s idea. Take note of your thoughts for and against it. Take note of your anxieties, especially concerning the world becoming one community in its emergence and participation in the Greater Community. Take note of these things, for here you will understand that within yourself which supports your advancement and that which denies it. As you learn to look upon these things without condemnation but with true objectivity, you will understand why the world is in conflict. You will understand this, and you will not see this with hatred, malice or envy. You will see this with understanding and compassion. This will teach you, then, how you must learn to work in the world so that you may fulfill your purpose here.",

Here you must only understand that there is a Greater Community and that it is a larger context in which life expresses itself. As humanity attempts to become one community and as you attempt to become one person instead of many people, you will realize that you emerge into the world as a larger person and the world emerges into the Greater Community as a larger community. Here all individuality seeks community, for in community it finds its true expression, its true contribution and its true role. This is as true for you as it is for the world. You can feel this. It is so evident. You can know this, for this idea is born of Knowledge. Don’t burden yourself with trying to understand all of this, for understanding is not necessary here. Only know and feel the reality of this. As you do this, your understanding will grow naturally. It will not be born of your own fantasy or idealism, but instead will be born of Knowledge and experience. Thus, it will abide with you, serve you and make your life more real and effective. Remember that you will understand as you proceed, for understanding is born of hindsight and true application. Have confidence, then, that your understanding will grow as your participation grows. You need not understand the universe, but you do need to experience it. You need to feel it within yourself and around you. You need to see yourself as one person, you need to see your world as one community and you need to see your universe as a Greater Community that, within a larger sphere of participation, is attempting to unify itself as well. Thus, Knowledge works in all arenas and at all levels of participation—within each person, within each community, within each world, between each world and within the universe as a whole. That is why Knowledge is so great and why, though you receive it within yourself, it is far greater than you can conceive of. Thus it is that now you may experience the Greater Community and not separate yourself in attempting to understand it. Understanding comes through participation. Remind yourself of today’s idea upon the hour and in your two deeper practice periods, attempt once again to think actively what this lesson means. Apply it to your experience. Apply it to your perception of the world. Recognize those thoughts that are for it and those that are against it. Recognize the inspiration and hope that this gives you and recognize the anxieties that may be aroused. Take inventory of your thoughts and experiences concerning today’s idea, but do not judge it, for it emanates from Knowledge. It is meant to free you from the disability of your own imagination. It is meant to free you and the world as well. Today utilize your mind and your body to become a student of Knowledge. In this, you will learn to comprehend the meaning of yourself, your world and the Greater Community of worlds.",

As you abide with Knowledge, feel Knowledge and carry Knowledge out into the world, within yourself you will be still, though on the outside you may be actively engaged. There is no contradiction between peace and movement, between inner stillness and outer engagement. Though the world is a difficult and frustrating place to be, it is a natural recipient of Knowledge. Its difficulties and its frustrations need not affect your internal state, which is becoming ever more unified and harmonious. Remind yourself upon the hour to be at peace while you are in the world. Release all fear and anxiety and fortify your adherence to Knowledge as you do so. In your two deeper practice periods when you take refuge from the world, rekindle the fire of Knowledge and take comfort in its warm presence.

They will need to be expanded so that you may recognize the extent of giving in the world. Upon the hour remind yourself to remember those who have given to you. Do not only think of those who you are certain have given to you, but remember those who you feel have hurt you, who have denied you or who have stood in your way. Remember them, for they have given something to you as well. They have given you a reminder that Knowledge is necessary, and they have demonstrated to you a life without Knowledge. They have demonstrated to you that Knowledge is attempting to emerge in them as well. Whether they accept or resist this emergence, it is still present and still manifesting itself. You are advancing because others have demonstrated their inspiration and their errors to you—their acceptance of Knowledge and their denial of Knowledge. If there were no denial of Knowledge in the world, you could not learn here. You could not recognize the importance of Knowledge. Contrast in learning will teach you what is valuable and what is not, and this will teach you to be compassionate and to be loving. Understanding this will enable you to serve in the world. Upon the hour recognize who is giving to you at that moment and recognize who has given to you in the past. In this way, this will be a day of gratitude and appreciation. You will understand how important your preparation is and how many have given themselves to you to serve you so that you may undertake this preparation. In your two deeper meditation practices, repeat today’s idea and then allow to come into your mind each individual that awaits to be recognized and blessed by you.

Thank them for helping you to recognize your need for Knowledge. Thank them for showing you that there is no alternative to Knowledge. And thank them for strengthening your participation in Knowledge. Bless each one and allow the next individual to come to mind. In this way, you will bless all who have been in your life and are in your life currently. In this way, you will learn to appreciate your past and not condemn it.

Only the free can love the world because only they can see that the world has supported and served them to enable them to become free and to become contributors to the world. Because the world so yearns for your contribution, it has given itself to your preparation so that you may learn to be a contributor. It has fortified this through the truth that exists in the world and through the denial of truth that exists in the world. In all ways, the world serves the emergence of Knowledge. Though the world contradicts Knowledge and seems to deny, to reject and to attack Knowledge, if seen from this perspective, you will realize that it actually serves Knowledge. How can anything compete with Knowledge? How can anything deny Knowledge? Anything that seems to deny Knowledge only calls for Knowledge and pleads for Knowledge to come. Those in confusion, in darkness and in despair yearn for relief and comfort. And though they do not understand the message of their own plight, those who are with Knowledge can perceive this and through Wisdom will learn how to serve these individuals, all individuals and the world as a whole. Today upon the hour remind yourself that as you become free, you will be able to love the world. As you learn to love the world, you will be able to become free because you are in this world but not of this world. Because you are in this world, you are representing that which you have brought with you from your Ancient Home. How simple and clear this is with Knowledge, and yet how difficult it is to grasp when you are in your own imagination and are entertaining your own separate ideas. That is why you practice—so you may confirm that which is natural to you and step away from that which is unnatural to you. In your deeper meditation practices once again receive the freedom that comes to you in stillness and receptivity. A mind that is still is a mind that is unfettered and free. It will naturally expand itself, and within this expansion it will naturally express that which is most natural to it.

Here all of your activities, even the most mundane and repetitive, can be seen as a form of service and contribution. In this way, all small things, however mundane and repetitive, can serve the world because they represent that you are honoring your True Self. This is the Self that exists in all individuals, the Self that exists in the world and the Self that exists in the Greater Community of worlds. Be attentive to the little things you do this day and do not neglect them. If you do not fear them, you will not resist them. If you do not resist them, you will be able to attend to them. And as you attend to them, you will be able to give yourself to them. Here Knowledge will express itself in all activities, and Knowledge will be taught and reinforced in all activities. The world needs this demonstration, for the world thinks that God, love, true power and inspiration exist only in ideal states and only in ideal situations. The world does not understand that God expresses God everywhere and that Knowledge expresses itself everywhere and in all things. As you come to understand this great truth, you will see the presence of Knowledge in all things. You will see Knowledge within the world. You will see Knowledge within yourself. This will give you complete confidence in your own participation and in your own service to Knowledge. You will then realize that you are saving the world time in its evolvement, advancement and salvation. This is so important for your confidence. But it is even more important for you to realize the greatness of Knowledge and the greatness that you will experience within yourself as you learn to receive it. Upon the hour remember today’s idea and apply it so that you may be conscientious within each hour. In your two deeper meditation practices, re-enter stillness so that you may rekindle your experience of the fire of Knowledge so that the fire of Knowledge may purify and cleanse your mind and free it from all restraint. In this way, you will be able to be in the world more completely, and small things will not be neglected.",

      "instructions": "Look at nature around you. Look at the tiniest creature and realize the mystery of that creature’s existence, the wonder of its physical mechanism and the truth of its total inclusion in nature as a whole. The smallest creature can express the greatest truth. The simplest thing can express the power of the universe. Does a creature that is small express life and inclusion in life any less than a creature that is great? Using this analogy, realize that the smallest activity can embody the greatest teaching. Realize that the simplest word, the most common gesture, can express the deepest feeling and emotion. Realize that the simplest thing can add to your practice and confirm the presence of Knowledge within you. As you become attentive to life, you will begin to witness the mystery of life in all things. How great this will be for you who are now awakening from the sleep of your own separate imagination. The mystery of life will inspire you and call to you. It will confirm the mystery of your own life, which is becoming ever more real and demonstrative to you. You may feel small, but you express the great. You do not need to be great to express the great because greatness is within you, and your physical vehicle is small in comparison to it. Your reality is born of the greatness that is with you that wishes to express itself in the simplicity of your small vehicle. Here you understand that you are of the great and you are working through the small. Here you will not contradict the relationship between the great and the small, where the small must express the great, which it does naturally. Does a little creature have to attempt to express the great? No. The great merely expresses itself through the little creature. Thus, in your life—which at any moment may look small to you, which at any moment may look separate and confined—greatness is with you. Therefore, the small is utilized, confirmed, honored and blessed. Then there is no basis for selfcondemnation and hatred. All things great and small become appreciated, for all things great and small are together. Upon the hour, then, within whatever small task, within whatever expression or gesture and within whatever small view, allow the great to express itself. In your two deeper practice periods, come again into the proximity of that which is great within you. Re-enter the fire of Knowledge which purifies you. Take sanctuary in the sanctuary of Knowledge. Here you encounter the great completely. This is beyond all form. Here that which infuses all form and gives it purpose, meaning and direction awaits you to receive it. The small expresses the great, and the great blesses the small.",

Thus, you need not attempt the impossible and can relieve your mind of a great burden that would otherwise overshadow your happiness and dispel your sense of peace and meaningful activity today. When you accept that you are only beginning to comprehend the meaning of your life and the meaning of Knowledge within your life, this frees you to participate and to learn more. Without the burden of judgment, which you would place upon your life otherwise, you are free to participate and your participation will make you free. Remind yourself upon the hour that you are only beginning to comprehend the meaning of Knowledge in your life. In your deeper practice periods, once again enter your sanctuary of Knowledge so that your capacity for Knowledge may grow, your desire for Knowledge may grow and your experience of Knowledge may grow.

In this gift, your Teachers will give to you the ideas and inspiration that you need. In this, you will express what you have received and thus confirm what you have received. Practice remembering this upon the hour by once again concentrating on the presence that is with you. You need only relax to feel it, for it is most certainly with you. In your deeper practices, once again enter stillness in the sanctuary of Knowledge so that you may receive this presence and the great confirmation and comfort that it gives to you. Allow yourself to leave self-doubt and the sense of unworthiness aside, for these things will be consumed in the fire of Knowledge and purified from your mind. When this is done, you will not need to give yourself grandiose ideas of yourself. You will not need to misrepresent yourself in the attempt to escape your sense of guilt and inadequacy, for guilt and inadequacy are consumed in the fire of Knowledge. Therefore, bring all that obstructs your participation and all fears that haunt and oppress you to the fire of Knowledge so that they may be consumed.

Nothing you can see in the world can possibly give you the certainty, the power, the peace and the sense of inclusion that the fire of Knowledge can bestow. Nothing can remind you of your total inclusion in life more than the presence of your Teachers who abide with you.

Thus it is that you cannot be alone, and thus it is that your individuality has great promise and purpose in the world. Thus it is that you who are part of the greatness that is greater than your individuality and you who are part of your individuality as well become whole and unified. In this, everything that you have constructed for yourself is turned for good. All of your creations are given purpose, meaning, direction and inclusion in life. Thus, your life is redeemed and reclaimed, and you become part of life and a vehicle for its unique expression. This is the true meaning of today’s lesson. Only in the shadows and the darkness of imagination can you hide from the light of truth. You must believe that you are alone to think that your imaginings are real. To learn that you are not alone at first may seem fearful because you are afraid that your imaginings and guilt would be revealed. Yet as you consider this honestly and without condemnation, you realize that it means that you have been reclaimed, rejuvenated and are now being prepared to receive the power that abides with you, the power that is your Source and True Self. Repeat today’s idea upon the hour and realize that it is an affirmation of your strength and inclusion in life. In your deeper meditations allow yourself to re-enter the stillness of your sanctuary of Knowledge where it will become evident that you are not alone.

All things of true value would not emanate, for the darkness of imagination and the darkness of fear would cover the world permanently and all would live in complete darkness. Without the presence of love in the world, this would be the case. Your life here would be sealed in darkness, and you would never be able to escape. That is why your life in the world is temporary. It could not be permanent, for you are born of the light, to which you will return. How could you live in darkness permanently when you are born of the light, to which you will return? You have been sent into the world to bring the light into the world, not to confirm the world’s darkness. God’s Will is that you bring the light into the world, not that you be banished to the world in darkness. You are here to bring the light into the world. You who are a student of Knowledge are now learning step by step to receive the light of Knowledge and the fire of Knowledge. As you experience this within yourself, you will see the fire of Knowledge burning in the world, for this is the presence of love. This is God within the world. What God does in the world God will do through you, but God’s presence in the world activates Knowledge in all minds and calls to all minds to awaken.

In your two longer practice periods today, in stillness and receptivity, practice receiving the power of Knowledge so that it may grow within you and so that you may have a greater and greater experience of it as you venture out into the world. These longer practice periods are so vital for your preparation, for they increase your capacity, they increase your comprehension, they increase your experience and they make it ever easier for you to experience Knowledge while you are in the world. For your Knowledge is your gift to the world, and your Knowledge is your gift to yourself.",

Your specific learning group requires that you advance so that it may itself advance, for it is seeking a greater union as well. Throughout time you have been cultivating your range of and capacity for relationship. All of your successes thus far are embodied in the expression and the evidence of your Spiritual Family. The return to God is the return to inclusion in relationship. This is beyond your ability to comprehend, and it is certainly beyond your ideas and your idealism. It can only be experienced. It must be experienced, and through this experience you will understand that you have come here not only for your own redemption and not only to serve the world, but to serve those who have sent you. In this, your role becomes ever more important. In this, your preparation becomes ever more important. If you think of this, you will know that it is true. Upon the hour today think of this idea and remember your Spiritual Family, whom you are now learning to remember. In your two deeper meditation practices, re-enter your sanctuary of Knowledge and attempt to experience the presence of your Spiritual Family. If your mind is still, you will realize that they are with you now. How could they be apart from you who cannot be apart from them, and as you are in the world they are with you now.",

      "instructions": "You are in the world to work. Work is what you want to do. Work is why you have come. But what is this work that We speak of? Is it your current employment, which you resist and have difficulty with? Is it the many tasks that you think are your own and that you assign to yourself? Your true work may be expressed in any of these activities, but it is truly greater. It will be your happiness and your fulfillment to carry out each step of your true work. Your true work in the world is to discover your Knowledge and allow it to express itself through you. Your true work in the world is to respond to your specific calling, which engages you with certain people in certain ways so that you may fulfill your individual destiny in the world. This is your work. Do not think at this moment that you can understand what this work is and do not try to give it definition beyond what We have given you. It is all right not to know fully what this means. It is all right to apprehend the mystery of your life without attempting to make it concrete. You are in the world to work. Therefore, apply yourself so that your application may reveal to you the source of your purpose, meaning and direction. It is through your work and meaningful activity that you will experience your value—the value of your individual life and the assurance of your true destiny. Your true work guarantees you all things of value and provides you escape from all things that conceal you and render you helpless and miserable. Remind yourself of today’s idea upon the hour. In your two deeper practices, once again engage your mind actively in considering today’s idea. Consider how you view work itself and all of your associations with work. Review how you have responded to work in the past—your desire to work, your ambivalence concerning work and your resistance to work. Recognize how all desire to escape work has really been a desire to discover Knowledge. Realize that Knowledge will engage you with work with new purpose, new meaning and new direction. Examine your thoughts. You must understand your thoughts, for they are still very effective in influencing your perception and your understanding. When you can become objective with your own mind, you will be able to allow Knowledge to shine upon it, and you will be able to use the power of decision to prepare yourself and to work with the content of your mind. This is effective within your range of participation, for it is not given you to determine the purpose, the meaning or the direction of Knowledge, but to become the recipient of Knowledge, to experience Knowledge and to allow Knowledge to express itself through you. Thus, in your two longer practice periods engage your mind actively. Concentrate on this one idea. Recognize all the thoughts and feelings that are associated with it. In the last portion of each long practice period, allow all thoughts to leave you. Re-enter stillness and receptivity so that you may come to know. Knowledge does not require your thinking when you are experiencing Knowledge itself, for all thinking is a replacement for Knowledge. Yet Knowledge will direct all your thinking to serve a greater purpose.",

Be attentive this day and learn to observe your outer life and your inner life objectively. In this way, you may experience what is truly there, and you will love what is truly there, for what is truly there is true and reflects love itself. Upon the hour remind yourself to observe your life unfolding. Within your deeper meditation practices, in stillness and receptivity, observe your inner life unfolding. Observe your outer life and inner life unfolding together as they must. Here you will feel the movement of your life. Here you will know that your life is being guided and directed.

Your eyes will see this, your ears will hear it, your skin will sense it and you will feel it with your entire physical and mental being. You will know this because your being knows while your mind thinks and your body acts. Thus it is that the power of Knowledge is the power of being, of which you are a part. It is with this power that you can observe the world unfolding, for the world has a being, a mind and a body. Its being knows, its mind thinks and its body acts. Nature is its body. Your collective thinking is its mind. Knowledge is its being. Thus, as you begin to realize Knowledge within your life, you will realize Knowledge within the world. As you see Knowledge cleansing and purifying your mind, you will see Knowledge cleansing and purifying all minds in your world. As you see Knowledge guiding you into effective action, you will see Knowledge in the world guiding others into effective action. Thus, as you learn to have compassion towards yourself, you will learn to have compassion towards the world. As you witness your own unfoldment, you will witness the world’s unfoldment. Today upon the hour repeat this idea and bear witness to the unfoldment of the world. In your two longer practice periods today, with your eyes open, gaze upon the world around you. Spend these times alone, gazing upon the world around you. Look without judgment. Feel the world unfolding. You need not try to feel this. You will feel it because it is natural. Without obstruction or intervention on your part, this experience will be ever present and available to you. Feel the world unfolding, for it will confirm all that you are learning now, and all that you are learning now will serve the world in its unfoldment.",

Your past has been frustrated and dismal because you have attempted to serve things without foundation and meaning. You have attempted to identify with things without purpose and direction. This has rendered to you the feeling that you have no purpose, meaning or direction. Feel happy now that you can represent the truth and serve the truth, for the truth gives you all that is true. It gives you purpose, meaning and direction which are what you have sought in all of your engagements, relationships, activities and endeavors. This is what you have sought in all of your fantasies, in all of your concerns and in all of your hopes. Everything you have truly wanted is being given to you now. Learn now to receive what you have truly wanted, and you will realize what is true. You will also realize what you have always truly wanted. This enables the truth to become simple and evident. This enables your own individual nature to become simple and evident, for in simplicity all things are known. In complexity all things are concealed. Only what is mechanical in the world can be complex, yet its essence is simple and can be directly experienced. Only in controlling what is mechanical in life, which you must do to a certain extent, are there complexities, but even these complexities are simple to determine step by step. Thus, your approach to life must be simple, whether you are dealing with simplicity or complexity. The complexity that We speak of, which is a form of denial, represents the complexity of your own thinking and the difficulty in your own approach. Be happy, then, that you can serve that which is true, for this will simplify all things and will enable you to deal with mechanical complexity in a direct and effective manner. Be happy, then, that your life has purpose, meaning and direction, for you serve that which has purpose, meaning and direction. Remember this upon the hour, and in your two deeper practice periods re-enter stillness with great receptivity and devotion. Remember that you give yourself here, that practice is giving, that you are learning to give and that you are learning to serve. You give what is true and you serve what is true, and as a result you experience what is true and you receive what is true. Therefore, this is a day of happiness because you serve what is true.",

Keep in mind that important change is gradual and often goes unnoticed until its results become evident. Realize that minor or insignificant change often involves great emotional upheavals where people think that something tremendous has just happened. The greater change is deeper and changes everything. Small, incremental change affects your point of view immediately, but its overall effect is not that lasting. The only exception to this is when your Teachers intervene into your personal sphere to demonstrate their presence or to deliver a message of potency that you absolutely require at that moment. These interventions are rare but can occur on occasion when it is required for your own behalf. Therefore, view the overall movement of your life. View your life unfolding. This is preparing you for the future, for this program is preparing you for the future. Everything that is taught here you must utilize and reinforce, and you must practice both within the scope of this preparation and far beyond it as well.

These are not the final steps in your overall approach to Knowledge or in your utilization and experience of Knowledge. Yet they are the final steps in this one great stage of development in which you are now engaged. Therefore, give yourself to the next section of practice with increased desire and intensity. Allow Knowledge to direct you in your participation. Allow yourself to be this powerful, this strong and this involved. Do not think of your past, but realize the reality of Knowledge in the moment and its great promise for the future. You are honored who honor the source of your preparation. You arehonored this day as you begin the final Steps in this essentialstage of your development. ~ Repeat this idea upon the hour and do not forget. As you strengthen this understanding, it will become ever more real and apparent to you. As it becomes ever more real, all other ideas and notions that compete with it will fade away, for this one great truth has substance. All other things which pretend to be the truth and are in conflict with this will fade because they are without substance. That which is true exists whether you want it or not, whether you believe in it or not and whether you adhere to it or not. That is what makes it true. You have thought in the past that all things exist because you wanted them to. This is only true in the realm of imagination, a realm that you are learning now to escape. Even in the realm of imagination, you learn to value that which is closest to the truth so that you may escape the realm of imagination. For the realm of imagination is not the realm of Creation. What creates, creates from Knowledge. This is Creation that is permanent, meaningful and has true power and value even in the world. It is not the realm of imagination. In your deeper practice periods enter stillness. Come with great reverence for what you are attempting to do. Remind yourself of the importance of these times of stillness. Remind yourself that these are times of worship, times of true dedication, times where you open yourself and times where Knowledge opens itself. Allow this day to be a day of greater comprehension.

It may seem contradictory that you can be away from your True Home and be at home, but you only seem to be away from Home as you look upon the world and identify with the world you see. But within yourself you carry Knowledge, which is a reminder that you are truly at home and that you are in the world to extend your True Home into the world.

Because it has been used as a substitute, its own inherent confusion and lack of foundation have disabled your communication and expression. Therefore, you have not found the source of your expression or the best vehicle for your expression. That your True Self wishes to express itself is evident in all of your past activities if you will understand them objectively. Everything you have ever said to anyone contains a seed of true expression. Everything you have ever done or attempted to demonstrate contains the seed of true demonstration and expression. You need only purify your expression to have it be complete and truly representative of your nature and, therefore, truly satisfying to you. Because you are here to express your Self, you must also learn how to express your Self, how your true expressions will affect others and how this effect can be utilized appropriately, for your well-being and their well-being as well.

Understanding this will enable you to value your contribution and engage yourself completely in its expression. To escape the world without contributing to the world will only compound your dilemma, and you will return to your Spiritual Family with your gifts unopened and undelivered. You will then realize that you must return because the work that you set out to accomplish in the world was not accomplished. Be glad, then, that you are in the world now and that you need not wait to re-enter. You are here already. You have progressed this far. You are in the perfect position to fulfill your destiny here. You have brought your Ancient Home with you—within the seed and within the light of your Knowledge, which is now growing, emerging and sprouting forth. The world is not your home, but you are meant to be at home in the world. Upon the hour think of this and realize how much you want to be at home in the world.

When you are at home in the world, you will be able to move beyond the world to serve in a greater way and to experience a greater reality than the world can present to you. But you will not leave with regret, with anger or with disappointment. You will leave with happiness and satisfaction. This will complete your experience here. This will bless the world and will bless you who have blessed yourself and the world while you were in the world. In your deeper meditation practices, allow yourself to seriously consider what home means to you. Again, this is a practice of active mental engagement. Utilize your mind to consider the important things that are being given to you now. You will need to examine all the thoughts you have in relation to today’s idea in order to understand how you are approaching today’s idea and how you will respond to it. The power of decision is yours, but you must understand the current content of your mind. With this, you will be able to make an appropriate and wise decision on your own behalf, within your range of responsibility. You are meant to be at home in the world. Bring home with you so that others may feel at home in the world. In this way, the world becomes blessed because it is not a place apart any longer. Do not escape the world today, but be present to serve the world.",

You will be engaged in every activity, and every activity will be important and meaningful. Then you will not seek escape from your experience, you will not seek escape from the world and you will not seek to find a dark place in which to hide, for you will realize the light of Knowledge is totally beneficent. You will wish to bathe in it more and more and express it more and more within the world. This is your duty here and your great love. Upon the hour remind yourself that you wish to be present to serve the world. Remind yourself as well that you wish to be present to have the world serve you. Remind yourself that you must learn how to receive and how to give, and that is why you are a beginning student of Knowledge. Do not burden yourself with expectations of yourself beyond what is being indicated in your program of preparation. Your Teachers recognize your current stage and they recognize your current step. They do not underestimate your power, but they do not overestimate your current capabilities, either. That is why you will need them to proceed with certainty, honesty and reliability. In your deeper practices, be present to give yourself to your practice in stillness. Remember again that all practice is giving. You are giving yourself so that your True Self may be given to you. Here you bring what is small to what is great and what is great brings itself to what is small. Here you realize that you too are great and that the small is meant to express the greatness of which you are a part. The world calls desperately for this greatness to be revealed, yet you must learn how to reveal greatness in the world.",

      "instructions": "With simplicity, humility and without false assumptions, remembering that you are a beginning student of Knowledge, you will be able to learn how to reveal greatness in the world. This is quite essential because the world is ambivalent towards greatness, towards Knowledge and towards love. If you present the world’s desire to it when the world is in an ambivalent state, it will not know how to react. Therefore, its reaction will either demonstrate that it is for or against your contribution. Any individual, any community or any world that is beset with ambivalence will react in more than one way because it is ambivalent. For this reason you must learn to approach ambivalence with wisdom, for those who are ambivalent must learn how to receive their certainty, as you are now learning to do. Recognize thus far how ambivalent you have been regarding your life and regarding this preparation. Realize that for this reason, this preparation has been given to you in very incremental steps, one step at a time, day after day. One step at a time, you learn to develop and to accept your desire and capacity for Knowledge and you learn to express Knowledge as well. Being a student means you are here to learn, and as you learn you will demonstrate, teach and produce the great results that Knowledge wishes to produce. Yet Knowledge cannot exceed your limitations because Knowledge cares for you and protects you as its vehicle. Because you are a part of Knowledge, you will wish to care for your vehicle as well. That is why you must take the utmost care of your mind and body as you proceed. Today in your deeper practice periods, allow yourself to be instructed in how to reveal greatness in the world. Realize that the world is ambivalent and accept this, for this is the current state of the world. Realize that you must give with wisdom and discernment. And realize that you must let Knowledge give of itself and not try to give from your own ambition or need to avoid a sense of inadequacy. Allow your giving to be true and your giving will be true. Your giving, then, will give of itself in a way that is appropriate, that will preserve you and that will honor those who receive your gift. This will bring them out of their ambivalence, as you are now being led into the light yourself.",

Whether you are alone or with others, whether you are at work or at home and whether you are in a situation that is pleasant or unpleasant, carry Knowledge within you. Feel it burning in your heart. Feel it filling the great expanse of your mind. In your two deeper practice periods, re-enter the sanctuary of Knowledge so that you may be refreshed and renewed, so that you may be blessed and honored and so that you may find reprieve and freedom.

You are learning to express Knowledge. You are learning to cultivate all of your mental and physical faculties that are essential for this overall preparation. You are a consummate student. Therefore, be totally engaged with your studenthood today, which will free you from false assumptions and from placing impossible burdens upon yourself. That which is given in truth you will naturally be able to do, for you are naturally created to do this. Your physical and mental vehicles, those things that are tied to this world, will naturally be engaged in your true fulfillment. Learn to learn. Learning to learn means that you are learning to participate. It means you are both following and leading all at once. You follow your Teachers and their program for development, and you lead your mental and physical vehicles. In this way, leading and following become all the same, as giving and receiving are all the same. Thus it is that those who receive will give and those who follow will lead. Thus it is that those who give will need to continue to receive and those who lead will need to continue to follow. Here the duality of such things disappears. Their uniformity and their complementary natures are recognized because this is simple, because it is apparent and because it is true. Remember this idea upon the hour and use your two practice periods to engage yourself with Knowledge in stillness and simplicity. Allow these final practice periods in this program to have great depth. Give yourself to them as completely as you can, for in doing so you will increase your capacity for Knowledge and your experience of Knowledge. As your capacity and experience of Knowledge grow, your desire for Knowledge will grow as well, for Knowledge is your true desire.",

It is because you have misinterpreted your desires or have attempted to use them to fortify other things that they have led you astray. Do not attempt to be without desire, for life is desire. Desire is purpose. Desire is meaning and direction. Yet you must recognize your true desire, which is the desire for Knowledge to fulfill itself and to claim itself, the desire for Knowledge to save you and for you to save Knowledge. How can you save Knowledge? By holding it within yourself, by being a student of Knowledge, by carrying Knowledge everywhere you go, by reinforcing your awareness of Knowledge, by being simple with Knowledge and by not attempting to use Knowledge to fulfill your own aims and your own purposes. Carry forth the normal activities of the day, but carry Knowledge with you. If Knowledge is not in doubt, you need not be in doubt. If Knowledge is not afraid, you need not be afraid. If Knowledge is not changing the situation, you need not change the situation. Yet if Knowledge holds you back, hold yourself back. If Knowledge changes the situation, change the situation. If Knowledge tells you to leave a circumstance, leave a circumstance. If Knowledge tells you to stay in a circumstance, stay in a circumstance. Here you become as simple and as powerful as Knowledge. Here you become Knowledge itself. Upon the hour repeat the idea for today and experience it. Within your inner life, experience it as well in your deeper meditation practices. Your inner and outer life are where you apply yourself and where you give yourself. They are where you carry Knowledge. In time, you will see that Knowledge will carry you.",

And you will feel that you are carrying Knowledge as well. Seen correctly, you will realize your true relationship to Knowledge. You will realize that you carry Knowledge within you and that Knowledge carries your well-being within itself. This is perfectly complementary. It is perfect because it is born of perfection itself. Be a true student of Knowledge. Engage yourself in practice. Give yourself in practice. Do not alter your practice. Do not neglect your practice.

In this final step in this stage of your preparation, give yourself and your entire day to practice. Honor yourself for accomplishing a remarkable and substantial task in completing this one year of preparation. Honor your Knowledge for giving you the desire to participate and the strength to participate. Honor your Knowledge for giving you the vision that is now emerging. Honor all who have served you in your life—your family, your parents, your friends and your seeming enemies and adversaries. Honor all who have enabled you to value Knowledge and who have given you the strength and the resolve to undertake the preparation for Knowledge. Remember your Teachers as well, for they remember you and abide with you even now. Remember that you are a student of Knowledge, and with this you will be able to proceed forward in your preparation. Today upon the hour and in your two deeper meditation practices, give yourself. Consider all that is given to you. Let this be a day of accomplishment and gratitude. Let this be a day to honor that Knowledge is real in you and that you are real in Knowledge. Open yourself to the next step beyond this program. The next step is awaiting you—a step that will meaningfully engage you with other students of Knowledge, a step that will meaningfully engage you with those who have advanced beyond what you have accomplished thus far, a step that will engage you in serving those who are only beginning to advance in the stage that you have just completed. Thus, you receive from those ahead of you and you give to those behind you. Thus, all are nurtured and supported in their return Home to God. Thus it is that you follow and you lead, you receive and you give. Thus it is that all of your activities become uniform and you find escape from all negative imagination. Thus it is that you are a student of Knowledge. And thus it is that Knowledge blesses you who are meant to bless the world. Nasi Novare Coram",
